<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>CAREW'S CELIA.&mdash;LUCY SACHEVEREL.</h3>


<p>From the reign of Charles the First may be dated that revolution in the
spirit and form of our lyric poetry, which led to its subsequent
degradation. The first Italian school of poetry, to which we owed our
Surreys, our Spensers, and our Miltons, had now declined. The high
contemplative tone of passion, the magnanimous and chivalrous homage
paid to women, gradually gave way before the French taste and French
gallantry, introduced, or at least encouraged and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> rendered fashionable,
by Henrietta Maria and her gay household. The muse of amatory poetry (I
presume there <i>is</i> such a Muse, though I know not to which of the Nine
the title properly applies,) no longer walked the earth star-crowned and
vestal-robed, "col dir pien d'intelletti, dolci ed alti,"&mdash;"with love
upon her lips, and looks commercing with the skies;"&mdash;she suited her
garb to the fashion of the times, and tripped along in guise of an
Arcadian princess, half regal, half pastoral, trailing a sheep-hook
crowned with flowers, and sparkling with foreign ornaments,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Pale glistering pearls and rainbow-coloured gems.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then in the "brisk and giddy paced times" of Charles the Second, she
flaunted an airy coquette, or an unblushing courtezan, ("unveiled her
eyes&mdash;unclasped her zone;") and when these sinful doings were banished,
she took the hue of the new morals&mdash;new fashions&mdash;new manners,&mdash;and we
find her a court prude, swimming in a hoop and red-heeled shoes,
"conscious of the rich brocade," and ogling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> behind her fan; or else in
the opposite extreme, like a <i>berg&egrave;re</i> in a French ballet, stuck over
with sentimental common-places and artificial flowers.</p>

<p>This, in general terms, was the progress of the lyric muse, from the
poets of Queen Elizabeth's days down to the wits of Queen Anne's. Of
course, there are modifications and exceptions, which will suggest
themselves to the poetical reader; but it does not enter into the plan
of this sketch to treat matters thus critically and profoundly. To
return then to the days of Charles the First.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that the union of Italian sentiment and imagination
with French vivacity and gallantry, was, in the commencement,
exceedingly graceful, before all poetry was lost in wit, and gallantry
sunk into licentiousness.</p>

<p>Carew, one of the first who distinguished himself in this style, has
been most unaccountably eclipsed by the reputation of Waller, and
deserved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> better than to have had his name hitched into line between
Sprat and Sedley;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Sprat, Carew, Sedley, and a hundred more.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As an amatory poet, he is far superior to Waller: he had equal
smoothness and fancy, and much more variety, tenderness, and
earnestness; if his love was less ambitiously, and even less honourably
placed, it was, at least, more deep seated, and far more fervent. The
real name of the lady he has celebrated under the poetical appellation
of Celia, is not known&mdash;it is only certain that she was no "fabled
fair,"&mdash;and that his love was repaid with falsehood.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Hard fate! to have been once possessed<br /></span>
<span class="i4">As victor of a heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Achieved with labour and unrest,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And then forced to depart!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>From the irregular habits of Carew, it is possible he might have set the
example of inconstancy; and yet this is but a poor excuse for <i>her</i>.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>
<p>Carew spent his life in the Court of Charles the First, who admired and
loved him for his wit and amiable manners, though he reproved his
<i>libertinage</i>. In the midst of that dissipation, which has polluted some
of his poems, he was full of high poetic feeling, and a truly generous
lover: for even while he wooes his fair one in the most soul-moving
terms of flowery adulation and tender entreaty, he puts her on her guard
against his own arts, and thus sweetly pleads against himself;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Rather let the lover pine,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Than his pale cheek should assign<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A perpetual blush to thine!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And his admiration of female chastity is elsewhere frequently, as well
as forcibly, expressed.&mdash;With all his elegance and tenderness, Carew is
never feeble; and in his laments there is nothing whining or unmanly.
After lavishing at the feet of his mistress the most passionate
devotion, and the most exquisite flattery, hear him rebuke her pride
with all the spirit of an offended poet!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Know, Celia! since thou art so proud,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">'Twas I that gave thee thy renown;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thou hadst in the forgotten crowd<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Of common beauties, lived unknown,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Had not my verse exhaled thy name,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And with it impt the wings of fame.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">That killing power is none of thine,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">I gave it to thy voice and eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thy sweets, thy graces, all are mine.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Thou art my star&mdash;shin'st in my skies;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then dart not from thy borrowed sphere<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Light'ning on him, who fixed thee there.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The identity of his Celia is now lost in a name,&mdash;and she deserves it:
perhaps had she appreciated the love she inspired, and been true to that
she professed, she might have won her elegant lover back to virtue, and
wreathed her fame with his for ever. Disappointed in the object of his
idolatry, Carew plunged madly into pleasure, and thus hastened his end.
He died, as Clarendon tells us, with "deep remorse for his past
excesses, and every manifestation of Christianity his best friends could
desire."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides his Celia, Carew has celebrated several other ladies of the
Court, and particularly Lady Mary Villars; the Countess of Anglesea;
Lady Carlisle, the theme of all the poets of her age, and her lovely
daughter, Lady Anne Hay, on whom he wrote an elegy, which begins with
some lines never surpassed in harmony and tenderness.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">I heard the virgin's sigh! I saw the sleek<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And polish'd courtier channel his fresh cheek<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With real tears; the new betrothed maid<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Smil'd not that day; the graver senate laid<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Their business by; of all the courtly throng<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Grief seal'd the heart, and silence bound the tongue!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">....*....*....*....*<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">We will not bathe thy corpse with a forc'd tear,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor shall thy train borrow the blacks they wear;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Such vulgar spice and gums embalm not thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That art the theme of Truth, not Poetry.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here Carew has fallen into the vulgar error, that <i>poetry</i> and <i>fiction</i>
are synonymous.</p>

<p>Lady Anne Wentworth,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> daughter of the first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> Earl of Cleveland, who,
after making terrible havoc in the heart of the Lord Chief Justice
Finch, married Lord Lovelace, is another of Carew's fair heroines. For
her marriage he wrote the epithalamium,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Break not the slumbers of the bride, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As Carew is not a <i>popular</i> poet, nor often found in a lady's library, I
add a few extracts of peculiar beauty.</p>


<h4>TO CELIA.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Ask me no more where Jove bestows,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When June is past, the fading rose;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For in your beauties orient dee<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Those flowers as in their causes sleep.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Ask me no more, whither do stray<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The golden atoms of the day;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For in pure love, Heaven did prepare<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Those powders to enrich your hair.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Ask me no more, whither doth haste<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The nightingale, when May is past;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For in your sweet dividing throat<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She winters, and keeps warm her note.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Ask me no more, where those stars light<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That downwards fall in dead of night;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
<span class="i2">For in your eyes they sit&mdash;and there<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fix'd become, as in their sphere.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Ask me no more, if east or west,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The ph&oelig;nix builds her spicy nest;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For unto you at last she flies,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And in your fragrant bosom dies.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">....*....*....*....*<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Ladies, fly from Love's smooth tale,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oaths steep'd in tears do oft prevail;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Grief is infectious, and the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Inflam'd with sighs, will blast the fair:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then stop your ears when lovers cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lest yourself weep, when no soft eye<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Shall with a sorrowing tear repay<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That pity which you cast away.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">....*....*....*....*<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And when thou breath'st, the winds are ready straight<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To filch it from thee; and do therefore wait<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Close at thy lips, and snatching it from thence,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Bear it to heaven, where 'tis Jove's frankincense.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fair goddess, since thy feature makes thee one,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yet be not such for these respects alone;<br /></span>

<p>The gallant and accomplished Colonel Lovelace was, I believe, a relation
of the Lord Lovelace who married Lady Anne Wentworth, and the friend and
contemporary of Carew. His fate and history would form the groundwork of
a romance; and in his person and character he was formed to be the hero
of one. He was as fearlessly brave as a knight-errant; so handsome in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
person, that he could not appear without inspiring admiration; a
polished courtier; an elegant scholar; and to crown all, a lover and a
poet. He wrote a volume of poems, dedicated to the praises of Lucy
Sacheverel, with whom he had exchanged vows of everlasting love. Her
poetical appellation, according to the affected taste of the day, was
<i>Lucasta</i>. When the civil wars broke out, Lovelace devoted his life and
fortunes to the service of the King; and on joining the army, he wrote
that beautiful song to his mistress, which has been so often quoted,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></div></div>

<p>The rest of his life was a series of the most cruel misfortunes. He was
imprisoned on account of his enthusiastic and chivalrous loyalty; but no
dungeon could subdue his buoyant spirit. His song "to Althea from
Prison," is full of grace and animation, and breathes the very soul of
love and honour.</p>

<p>Lovelace afterwards commanded a regiment at the siege of Dunkirk, where
he was severely, and, as it was supposed, mortally wounded. False
tidings of his death were brought to England; and when he returned, he
found his Lucy ("O most wicked haste!") married to another; it was a
blow he never recovered. He had spent nearly his whole patrimony in the
King's service, and now became utterly reckless. After wandering about
London in obscurity and penury, dissipating his scanty resources in riot
with his brother cavaliers, and in drinking the health of the exiled
King and confusion to Cromwell, this idol of women and envy of men,&mdash;the
beautiful, brave, high-born, and accomplished Lovelace, died miserably
in a little lodging in Shoe Lane. He was only in his thirty-ninth year.</p>

<p>The mother of Lucy Sacheverel was Lucy, daughter of Sir Henry Hastings,
ancestor to the present Marquis of Hastings. How could she so belie her
noble blood? I would excuse her were it possible, for she must have been
a fine creature to have inspired and appreciated such a sentiment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> as
that contained in the first song; but facts cry aloud against her. Her
plighted hand was not transferred to another, when time had sanctified
and mellowed regret; but with a cruel and unfeminine precipitancy. Since
then her lover has bequeathed her name to immortality, he is
sufficiently avenged. Let her stand forth condemned and scorned for
ever, as faithless, heartless,&mdash;light as air, false as water, and rash
as fire.&mdash;I abjure her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>WALLER'S SACHARISSA.</h3>


<p>The courtly Waller, like the lady in the Maids' Tragedy, loved with his
ambition,&mdash;not with his eyes; still less with his heart. A critic, in
designating the poets of that time, says truly that "Waller still lives
in Sacharissa:" he lives in her name more than she does in his poetry;
he gave that name a charm and a celebrity which has survived the
admiration his verses inspired, and which has assisted to preserve them
and himself from oblivion. If Sacharissa had not been a real and an
interesting object, Waller's poetical praises had died with her, and she
with them. He wants earnestness; his lines were not inspired by love,
and they give "no echo to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> seat where love is throned." Instead of
passion and poetry, we have gallantry and flattery; gallantry, which was
beneath the dignity of its object; and flattery, which was yet more
superfluous,&mdash;it was painting the lily and throwing perfume on the
violet.</p>

<p>Waller's Sacharissa was the Lady Dorothea Sydney, the eldest daughter of
the Earl of Leicester, and born in 1620. At the time he thought fit to
make her the object of his homage, she was about eighteen, beautiful,
accomplished, and admired. Waller was handsome, rich, a wit, and
five-and-twenty. He had ever an excellent opinion of himself, and a
prudent care of his worldly interests. He was a great poet, in days when
Spenser was forgotten, Milton neglected, and Pope unborn. He began by
addressing to her the lines on her picture,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Such was Philoclea and such Dorus' flame.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>
<p>Then we have the poems written at Penshurst,&mdash;in this strain,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Ye lofty beeches! tell this matchless dame,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That if together ye fed all one flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It could not equalise the hundredth part<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of what her eyes have kindled in my heart, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The lady was content to be the theme of a fashionable poet: but when he
presumed farther, she crushed all hopes with the most undisguised
aversion and disdain: thereupon he rails,&mdash;thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">To thee a wild and cruel soul is given,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">More deaf than trees, and prouder than the heaven;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Love's foe profest! why dost thou falsely feign<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thyself a Sydney? From which noble strain<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He sprung that could so far exalt the name<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of love, and warm a nation with his flame.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>His mortified vanity turned for consolation to Amoret, (Lady Sophia
Murray,) the intimate companion of Sacharissa. He describes the
friendship between these two beautiful girls very gracefully.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Tell me, lovely, loving pair!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Why so kind, and so severe?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Why so careless of our care<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Only to yourselves so dear?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">....*....*....*....*<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Not the silver doves that fly<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Yoked to Cytherea's car;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Not the wings that lift so high,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And convey her son so far,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Are so lovely, sweet and fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Or do more ennoble love,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Are so choicely matched a pair,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Or with more consent do move.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And they are very beautifully contrasted in the lines to Amoret&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">If sweet Amoret complains,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I have sense of all her pains;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But for Sacharissa, I<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Do not only grieve, but die!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">....*....*....*....*<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">'Tis amazement more than love,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which her radiant eyes do move;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If less splendour wait on thine,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yet they so benignly shine,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
<span class="i2">I would turn my dazzled sight<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To behold their milder light.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">....*....*....*....*<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Amoret! as sweet and good<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As the most delicious food,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which but tasted does impart<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Life and gladness to the heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sacharissa's beauty's wine,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which to madness doth incline,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Such a liquor as no brain<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That is mortal, can sustain.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But Lady Sophia, though of a softer disposition, and not carrying in her
mild eyes the scornful and destructive light which sparkled in those of
Sacharissa, was not to be "berhymed" into love any more than her fair
friend. She applauded, but she repelled; she smiled, but she was cold.
Waller consoled himself by marrying a city widow, worth thirty thousand
pounds.</p>

<p>The truth is, that with all his wit and his elegance of fancy, of which
there are some inimitable examples,&mdash;as the application of the story of
Daphne, and of the fable of the wounded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> eagle; the lines on
Sacharissa's girdle; the graceful little song, "Go, lovely Rose," to
which I need only allude, and many others,&mdash;Waller has failed in
convincing us of his sincerity. As Rosalind says, "Cupid might have
clapped him on the shoulder, but we could warrant him heart-whole." All
along our sympathy is rather with the proud beauty, than with the
irritable self-complacent poet. Sacharissa might have been proud, but
she was not arrogant; her manners were gentle and retiring; and her
disposition rather led her to shun than to seek publicity and
admiration.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Such cheerful modesty, such humble state,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Moves certain love, but with as doubtful fate;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As when beyond our greedy reach, we see<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Inviting fruit on too sublime a tree.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The address to Sacharissa's <i>femme-de-chambre</i>, beginning, "Fair
fellow-servant," is not to be compared with Tasso's ode to the Countess
of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> Scandiano's maid, but contains some most elegant lines.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">You the soft season know, when best her mind<br /></span>
<span class="i2">May be to pity, or to love inclined:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In some well-chosen hour supply his fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whose hopeless love durst never tempt the ear<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of that stern goddess; you, her priest, declare<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What offerings may propitiate the fair:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Rich orient pearl, bright stones that ne'er decay,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or polished lines, that longer last than they.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">But since her eyes, her teeth, her lip excels<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All that is found in mines or fishes' shells,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Her nobler part as far exceeding these,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">None but immortal gifts her mind should please.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These lines impress us with the image of a very imperious and disdainful
beauty; yet such was not the character of Sacharissa's person or
mind.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Nor is it necessary to imagine her such, to account for her
rejection of Waller, and her indifference to his flattery. There was a
meanness about the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> man: he wanted not birth alone, but all the high and
generous qualities which must have been required to recommend him to a
woman, who, with the blood and the pride of the Sydneys, inherited their
large heart and noble spirit. We are not surprised when she turned from
the poet to give her hand to Henry Spencer, Earl of Sunderland, one of
the most interesting and heroic characters of that time. He was then
only nineteen, and she was about the same age. This marriage was
celebrated with great splendour at Penshurst, July 30, 1639.</p>

<p>Waller, who had professed that his hope</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">Should ne'er rise higher<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Than for a pardon that he dared admire,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>pressed forward with his congratulations in verse and prose, and wrote
the following letter, full of pleasant imprecations, to Lady Lucy
Sydney, the younger sister of Sacharissa. It will be allowed that it
argues more wit and good nature than love or sorrow; and that he was
resolved that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> willow should sit as gracefully and lightly on his
brow, as the myrtle or the bays.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"To my Lady Lucy Sydney, on the marriage of my Lady
Dorothea, her Sister.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Madam.</span>&mdash;In this common joy, at Penshurst, I know none to
whom complaints may come less unseasonable than to your
Ladyship,&mdash;the loss of a bedfellow being almost equal to
that of a mistress; and therefore you ought, at least, to
pardon, if you consent not to the imprecations of the
deserted, which just Heaven, no doubt, will hear.</p>

<p>"May my Lady Dorothea, if we may yet call her so, suffer as
much, and have the like passion, for this young Lord, whom
she has preferred to the rest of mankind, as others have had
for her; and may this love, before the year come about, make
her taste of the first curse imposed on womankind&mdash;the pains
of becoming a mother. May her first-born be none of her own
sex, nor so like her, but that he may resemble her Lord as
much as herself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>"May she, that always affected silence and retiredness, have
the house filled with the noise and number of her children,
and hereafter of her grand-children, and then may she arrive
at that great curse, so much declined by fair ladies,&mdash;<i>old
age</i>. May she live to be very old, and yet seem young&mdash;be
told so by her glass&mdash;and have no aches to inform her of the
truth: and when she shall appear to be mortal, may her Lord
not mourn for her, but go hand-in-hand with her to that
place, where, we are told, there is neither marrying nor
giving in marriage, that being there divorced, we may all
have an equal interest in her again. My revenge being
immortal, I wish that all this may also befall their
posterity to the world's end and afterwards.</p>

<p>"To you, Madam, I wish all good things, and that this loss
may, in good time, be happily supplied with a more constant
bedfellow of the other sex.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Lady Sunderland had been married about three years; she and her youthful
husband lived in the tenderest union, and she was already the happy
mother of two fair infants, a son and a daughter,&mdash;when the civil wars
broke out, and Lord Sunderland followed the King to the field. In the
Sydney papers are some beautiful letters to his wife, written from the
camp before Oxford. The last of these, which is in a strain of playful
and affectionate gaiety, thus concludes,&mdash;"Pray bless Poppet for me!<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p><p>Three days afterwards this tender and gallant heart had ceased to beat:
he was killed in the battle of Newbury, at the age of three-and-twenty.
His unhappy wife, on hearing the news of his death, was prematurely
taken ill, and delivered of an infant, which died almost immediately
after its birth. She recovered, however, from a dangerous and protracted
illness, through the affectionate and unceasing attentions of her
mother, Lady Leicester, who never quitted her for several months. Her
father wrote her a letter of condolence, which would serve as a model
for all letters on similar occasions. "I know," he says, "that it is to
no purpose to advise you not to grieve; that is not my intention: for
such a loss as yours, cannot be received indifferently by a nature so
tender and sensible as yours," &amp;c. After touching lightly and delicately
on the obvious sources of consolation, he reminds her, that her duty to
the dead requires her to be careful of herself, and not hazard her very
existence by the indulgence of grief. "You offend him whom you loved, if
you hurt that person<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> whom he loved; remember how apprehensive he was of
your danger, how grieved for any thing that troubled you! I know you
lived happily together, so as nobody but yourself could measure the
contentment of it. I rejoiced at it, and did thank God for making me one
of the means to procure it for you," &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Those who have known deep sorrow, and felt what it is to shrink with
shattered nerves and a wounded spirit from the busy hand of consolation,
fretting where it cannot heal, will appreciate such a letter as this.</p>

<p>Lady Sunderland, on her recovery, retired from the world, and centering
all her affections in her children, seemed to live only for them. She
resided, after her widowhood, at Althorpe, where she occupied herself
with improving the house and gardens. The fine hall and staircase of
that noble seat, which are deservedly admired for their architectural
beauty, were planned and erected by her. After the lapse of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> about
thirteen years, her father, Lord Leicester, prevailed on her to choose
one from among the numerous suitors who sought her hand: he dreaded,
lest on his death, she should be left unprotected, with her infant
children, in those evil times; and she married, in obedience to his
wish, Sir Robert Smythe, of Sutton, who was her second cousin, and had
long been attached to her. She lived to see her eldest son, the second
Earl of Sunderland, a man of transcendant talents, but versatile
principles, at the head of the government, and had the happiness to
close her eyes before he had abused his admirable abilities, to the
vilest purposes of party and court intrigue. The Earl was appointed
principal Secretary of State in 1682: his mother died in 1683.</p>

<p>There is a fine portrait of Sacharissa at Blenheim, of which there are
many engravings. It must have been painted by Vandyke, shortly after her
marriage, and before the death of her husband. If the withered branch,
to which she is pointing, be supposed to allude to her widowhood, it
must have been added afterwards, as Vandyke<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> died in 1641, and Lord
Sunderland in 1643. In the gallery at Althorpe, there are three pictures
of this celebrated woman. One represents her in a hat, and at the age of
fifteen or sixteen, gay, girlish, and blooming: the second, far more
interesting, was painted about the time of her first marriage: it is
exceedingly sweet and lady-like. The features are delicate, with
redundant light brown air, and eyes and eyebrows of a darker hue; the
bust and hands very exquisite: on the whole, however, the high breeding
of the face and air is more conspicuous than the beauty of the person.
These two portraits are by Vandyke; nor ought I to forget to mention
that the painter himself was supposed to have indulged a respectful but
ardent passion for Lady Sunderland, and to have painted her portrait
literally <i>con amore</i>.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>A third picture represents her about the time of her second marriage:
the expression wholly changed,&mdash;cold, faded, sad, but still
sweet-looking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> and delicate. One might fancy her contemplating with a
sick heart, the portrait of Lord Sunderland, the lover and husband of
her early youth, and that of her unfortunate but celebrated brother,
Algernon Sydney; both which hang on the opposite side of the gallery.</p>

<p>The present Duke of Marlborough, and the present Earl Spencer, are the
lineal descendants of Waller's Sacharissa.</p>

<p>One little incident, somewhat prosaic indeed, proves how little heart
there was in Waller's poetical attachment to this beautiful and
admirable woman. When Lady Sunderland, after a retirement of thirty
years, re-appeared in the court she had once adorned, she met Waller at
Lady Wharton's, and addressing him with a smiling courtesy, she reminded
him of their youthful days:&mdash;"When," said she, "will you write such fine
verses on me again?"&mdash;"Madam," replied Waller, "when your Ladyship is
young and handsome again." This was contemptible and coarse,&mdash;the
sentiment was not that of a well-bred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> or a feeling man, far less that
of a lover or a poet,&mdash;no!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Love is not love,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That alters where it alteration finds.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>One would think that the sight of a woman, whom he had last seen in the
full bloom of youth and glow of happiness,&mdash;who had endured, since they
parted, such extremity of affliction, as far more than avenged his
wounded vanity, might have awakened some tender thoughts, and called
forth a gentler reply. When some one expressed surprise to Petrarch,
that Laura, no longer young, had still power to charm and inspire him,
he answered, "Piaga per allentar d'arco non sana,"&mdash;"The wound is not
healed though the bow be unbent." This was in a finer spirit.</p>

<p>Something in the same character, as his reply to Lady Sunderland, was
Waller's famous repartee, when Charles the Second told him that his
lines on Oliver Cromwell were better than those written on his royal
self. "Please your Majesty, we poets succeed better in fiction than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> in
truth." Nothing could be more admirably <i>apropos</i>, more witty, more
courtier-like: it was only <i>false</i>, and in a poor, time-serving spirit.
It showed as much meanness of soul as presence of mind. What true poet,
who felt as a poet, would have said this?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>BEAUTIES AND POETS.</h3>


<p>Nearly contemporary with Waller's Sacharissa lived several women of high
rank, distinguished as munificent patronesses of poetry, and favourite
themes of poets, for the time being. There was the Countess of Pembroke,
celebrated by Ben Jonson,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">The subject of all verse,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sydney's sister, Pembroke's mother.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There was the famous Lucy Percy, Countess of Carlisle, very clever, and
very fantastic, who aspired to be the Aspasia, the De Rambouillet of her
day, and did not quite succeed. She was celebrated by almost all the
contemporary poets,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> and even in French, by Voiture. There was Lucy
Harrington, Countess of Bedford, who, notwithstanding the accusation of
vanity and extravagance which has been brought against her, was an
amiable woman, and munificently rewarded, in presents and pensions, the
incense of the poets around her. I know not what her Ladyship may have
paid for the following exquisite lines by Ben Jonson; but the reader
will agree with me, that it could not have been <i>too</i> much.</p>


<h4>ON LUCY COUNTESS OF BEDFORD.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">This morning, timely rapt with holy fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">I thought to form unto my zealous muse<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What kind of creature I could most desire<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To honour, serve, and love; as poets use:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I meant to make her fair, and free, and wise,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Of greatest blood, and yet more good than great.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I meant the day-star should not brighter rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Nor lend like influence from his ancient seat.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I meant she should be courteous, facile, sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Hating that solemn vice of greatness, <i>pride</i>;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I meant each softest virtue there should meet,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Fit in that softer bosom to reside.<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Only a learned, and a manly soul<br /></span>
<span class="i4">I purpos'd her; that should, with even powers,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The rock, the spindle, and the sheers controul<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Of destiny, and spin her own free hours.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Such when I meant to feign, and wished to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My muse bade Bedford write,&mdash;and that was she.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There was also the "beautiful and every way excellent" Lady Anne
Rich,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> the daughter-in-law of her who was so loved by Sir Philip
Sydney; and the memorable and magnificent&mdash;but somewhat masculine&mdash;Anne
Clifford, Countess of Cumberland, Pembroke, and Dorset, who erected
monuments to Spenser, Drayton, and Daniel; and above them all, though
living a little later, the Queen herself, Henrietta Maria, whose
feminine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> caprices, French graces, and brilliant eyes, rendered her a
very splendid and fruitful theme for the poets of the time.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>There was at this time a kind of traffic between rich beauties and poor
poets. The ladies who, in earlier ages, were proud in proportion to the
quantity of blood spilt in honour of their charms, were now seized with
a passion for being berhymed. Surrey, and his Geraldine, began this
taste in England by introducing the school of Petrarch: and Sir Philip
Sydney had entreated women to listen to those poets who promised them
immortality,&mdash;"For thus doing, ye shall be most fair, most wise, most
rich, most every thing!&mdash;ye shall dwell upon superlatives:"<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and
women believed accordingly. In spite of the satirist, I do maintain,
that the love of praise and the love of pleasing are paramount in our
sex,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> both to the love of pleasure and the love of sway.</p>

<p>This connection between the high-born beauties and the poets was at
first delightful, and honourable to both: but, in time, it became
degraded and abused. The fees paid for dedications, odes, and sonnets,
were any thing but sentimental:&mdash;can we wonder if, under such
circumstances, the profession of a poet "was connected with personal
abasement, which made it disreputable?"<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> or, that women, while they
required the tribute, despised those who paid it,&mdash;and were paid for
it?&mdash;not in sweet looks, soft smiles, and kind wishes, but with silver
and gold, a cover at her ladyship's table "below the salt," or a bottle
of sack from my lord's cellar. It followed, as a thing of course, that
our amatory and lyric poetry declined, and instead of the genuine
rapture of tenderness, the glow of imagination, and all "the purple
light of love," we have too often only a heap of glittering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> and empty
compliment and metaphysical conceits.&mdash;It was a miserable state of
things.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that the aspiring loves of some of our poets have
not proved auspicious even when successful. Dryden married Lady
Elizabeth Howard, the daughter of the Earl of Berkshire: but not "all
the blood of all the Howards" could make her either wise or amiable: he
had better have married a milkmaid. She was weak in intellect, and
violent in temper. Sir Walter Scott observes, very feelingly, that "The
wife of one who is to gain his livelihood by poetry, or by any labour
(if any there be,) equally exhausting, must either have taste enough to
relish her husband's performances, or good nature sufficient to pardon
his infirmities." It was Dryden's misfortune, that Lady Elizabeth had
neither one nor the other.</p>

<p>Of all our really great poets, Dryden is the one least indebted to
woman, and to whom, in return, women are least indebted: he is almost
devoid of <i>sentiment</i> in the true meaning of the word.&mdash;"His<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> idea of
the female character was low;" his homage to beauty was not of that kind
which beauty should be proud to receive.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> When he attempted the
praise of women, it was in a strain of fulsome, far-fetched, laboured
adulation, which betrayed his insincerity; but his genius was at home
when we were the subject of licentious tales and coarse satire.</p>

<p>It was through this inherent want of refinement and true respect for our
sex, that he deformed Boccaccio's lovely tale of Gismunda; and as the
Italian novelist has sins enough of his own to answer for, Dryden might
have left him the beauties of this tender story, unsullied by the
profane coarseness of his own taste. In his tragedies, his heroines on
stilts, and his drawcansir heroes, whine, rant, strut and rage, and tear
passion to tatters&mdash;to very rags; but love, such as it exists in gentle,
pure, unselfish bosoms&mdash;love, such as it glows in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> the pages of
Shakspeare and Spenser, Petrarch and Tasso,&mdash;such love</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">As doth become mortality<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Glancing at heaven,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>he could not imagine or appreciate, far less express or describe. He
could pourtray a Cleopatra; but he could not conceive a Juliet. His
ideas of our sex seem to have been formed from a profligate actress,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
and a silly, wayward, provoking wife; and we have avenged
ourselves,&mdash;for Dryden is not the poet of women; and, of all our English
classics, is the least honoured in a lady's library.</p>

<p>Dryden was the original of the famous repartee to be found, I believe,
in every jest book: shortly after his marriage, Lady Elizabeth, being
rather annoyed at her husband's very studious habits, wished herself <i>a
book</i>, that she might have a little more of his attention.&mdash;"Yes, my
dear," replied Dryden, "an almanack."&mdash;"Why an almanack?" asked the wife
innocently.&mdash;"Because then, my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> dear, I should change you once a year."
The laugh, of course, is on the side of the wit; but Lady Elizabeth was
a young spoiled beauty of rank, married to a man she loved; and her
wish, methinks, was very feminine and natural: if it was spoken with
petulance and bitterness, it deserved the repartee; if with tenderness
and playfulness, the wit of the reply can scarcely excuse its
ill-nature.</p>

<p>Addison married the Countess of Warwick. Poor man! I believe his
patrician bride did every thing but beat him. His courtship had been
long, timid, and anxious; and at length, the lady was persuaded to marry
him, on terms much like those on which a Turkish Princess is espoused,
to whom the Sultan is reported to pronounce, "Daughter, I give thee this
man to be thy slave."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> They were only three years married, and those
were years of bitterness.</p>

<p>Young, the author of the Night Thoughts, married Lady Elizabeth Lee, the
daughter of the Earl<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> of Litchfield, and grand-daughter of the too
famous, or more properly, infamous Duchess of Cleveland:&mdash;the marriage
was not a happy one. I think, however, in the two last instances, the
ladies were not entirely to blame.</p>

<p>But these, it will be said, are the wives of poets, not the loves of the
poets; and the phrases are not synonymus,&mdash;<i>au contraire</i>. This is a
question to be asked and examined; and I proceed to examine it
accordingly. But as I am about to take the field on new ground, it will
require a new chapter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>CONJUGAL POETRY.</h3>


<p>If it be generally true, that Love, to be poetical, must be wreathed
with the willow and the cypress, as well as the laurel and the
myrtle,&mdash;still it is not <i>always</i> true. It is not, happily, a necessary
condition, that a passion, to be constant, must be unfortunate; that
faithful lovers must needs be wretched; that conjugal tenderness and
"domestic doings" are ever dull and invariably prosaic. The witty
invectives of some of our poets, whose domestic misery stung them into
satirists, and blasphemers of a happiness denied to them, are familiar
in the memory&mdash;ready on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> the lips of common-place scoffers. But of
matrimonial poetics, in a far different style, we have instances
sufficient to put to shame such heartless raillery; that there are not
more, is owing to the reason which Klopstock has given, when writing of
his angelic Meta. "A man," said he, "should speak of his wife as seldom
and with as much modesty as of himself."</p>

<p>A woman is not under the same restraint in speaking of her husband; and
this distinction arises from the relative position of the two sexes. It
is a species of vain-glory to boast of a possession; but we may exult,
unreproved, in the virtues of him who disposes of our fate. Our
inferiority has here given to us, as women, so high and dear a
privilege, that it is a pity we have been so seldom called on to exert
it.</p>

<p>The first instance of conjugal poetry which occurs to me, will perhaps
startle the female reader, for it is no other than the gallant Ovid
himself. One of the epistles, written during his banishment to Pontus,
is addressed to his wife Perilla, and very tenderly alludes to their
mutual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> affection, and to the grief she must have suffered during his
absence.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And thou, whom young I left when leaving Rome,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thou, by my woes art haply old become:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Grant, heaven! that such I may behold thy face,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And thy changed cheek, with dear loved kisses trace;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fold thy diminished person, and exclaim,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Regret for me has thinned this beauteous frame.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here then we have the most abandoned libertine of his profligate times
reduced at last in his old age, in disgrace and exile, to throw himself,
for sympathy and consolation, into the arms of a tender and amiable
wife; and this, after spending his life and talents in deluding the
tenderness, corrupting the virtue, and reviling the characters of women.
In truth, half a dozen volumes in praise of our sex could scarce say
more than this.</p>

<p>Every one, I believe, recollects the striking story of Paulina, the wife
of Seneca. When the order was brought from Nero that he should die, she
insisted upon dying with him, and by the same operation. She accordingly
prepared to be bled to death; but fainting away in the midst of her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
sufferings, Seneca commanded her wounds to be bound up, and conjured her
to live. She lived therefore; but excessive weakness and loss of blood
gave her, during the short remainder of her life, that spectral
appearance which has caused her conjugal fidelity and her pallid hue to
pass into a proverb,&mdash;"As pale as Seneca's Paulina;" and be it
remembered, that Paulina was at this time young in comparison of her
husband, who was old, and singularly ugly.</p>

<p>This picturesque story of Paulina affects us in our younger years; but
at a later period we are more likely to sympathise with the wife of
Lucan, Polla Argentaria, who beheld her husband perish by the same death
as his uncle Seneca, and, through love for his fame, consented to
survive him. She appears to have been the original after whom he drew
his beautiful portrait of Cornelia, the wife of Pompey. Lucan had left
the manuscript of the Pharsalia in an imperfect state; and his wife, who
had been in its progress his amanuensis, his counsellor and confidant,
and therefore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> best knew his wishes and intentions, undertook to revise
and copy it with her own hand. During the rest of her life, which was
devoted to this dear and pious task, she had the bust of Lucan always
placed beside her couch, and his works lying before her: and in the form
in which Polla Argentaria left it, his great poem has descended to our
times.</p>

<p>I have read also, though I confess my acquaintance with the classics is
but limited, of a certain Latin poetess Sulpicia, who celebrated her
husband Calenas: and the poet Ausonius composed many fine verses in
praise of a beautiful and virtuous wife, whose name I forget.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>But I feel I am treading unsafe ground, rendered so both by my
ignorance, and by my prejudices as a woman. Generally speaking, the
heroines of classical poetry and history are not much to my taste; in
their best virtues they were a little masculine, and in their vices, so
completely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> unsexed, that one would rather not think of them&mdash;speak of
them&mdash;far less write of them.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The earliest instance I can recollect of modern conjugal poetry, is
taken from a country, and a class, and a time where one would scarce
look for high poetic excellence inspired by conjugal tenderness. It is
that of a Frenchwoman of high rank, in the fifteenth century, when
France was barbarised by the prevalence of misery, profligacy, and
bloodshed, in every revolting form.</p>

<p>Margu&egrave;rite-El&eacute;onore-Clotilde de Surville, of the noble family of Vallon
Chalys, was the wife of B&eacute;renger de Surville, and lived in those
disastrous times which immediately succeeded the battle of Agincourt.
She was born in 1405, and educated in the court of the Count de Foix,
where she gave an early proof of literary and poetical talent, by
translating, when eleven years old, one of Petrarch's Canzoni, with a
harmony of style wonderful, not only for her age, but for the times in
which she lived. At the age of sixteen she married the Chevalier de
Surville, then, like herself, in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> bloom of youth, and to whom she
was passionately attached. In those days, no man of noble blood, who had
a feeling for the misery of his country, or a hearth and home to defend,
could avoid taking an active part in the scenes of barbarous strife
around him; and De Surville, shortly after his marriage, followed his
heroic sovereign, Charles the Seventh, to the field. During his absence,
his wife addressed to him the most beautiful effusions of conjugal
tenderness to be found, I think, in the compass of poetry. In the time
of Clotilde, French verse was not bound down by those severe laws and
artificial restraints by which it has since been shackled: we have none
of the prettinesses, the epigrammatic turns, the sparkling points, and
elaborate graces, which were the fashion in the days of Louis Quatorze.
Boileau would have shrugged up his shoulders, and elevated his eyebrows,
at the rudeness of the style; but Moli&egrave;re, who preferred</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">J'aime mieux ma mie, oh gai!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>to all the <i>fades galanteries</i> of his contemporary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> <i>bels esprits</i>,
would have been enchanted with the na&iuml;ve tenderness, the freshness and
flow of youthful feeling which breathe through the poetry of Clotilde.
The antique simplicity of the old French lends it such an additional
charm, that though in making a few extracts, I have ventured to
modernize the spelling, I have not attempted to alter a word of the
original.</p>

<p>Clotilde has entitled her first epistle "Hero&iuml;de &agrave; mon &eacute;poux B&eacute;renger;"
and as it is dated in 1422, she could not have been more than seventeen
when it was written. The commencement recalls the superscription of the
first letter of Helo&iuml;se to Abelard.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Clotilde, au sien ami, douce mande accolade!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">A son &eacute;poux, salut, respect, amour!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ah, tandis qu'eplor&eacute;e et de c&oelig;ur si malade,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Te quier<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> la nuit, te redemande au jour&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Que deviens? o&ugrave; cours tu? Loin de ta bien-aim&eacute;e,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">O&ugrave; les destins, entrainent donc tes pas?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'Faut que le dise, h&egrave;las! s'en crois la renomm&eacute;e<br /></span>
<span class="i4">De bien long temps ne te reverrai pas?<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>
<p>She then describes her lonely state, her grief for his absence, her
pining for his return. She laments the horrors of war which have torn
him from her; but in a strain of eloquent poetry, and in the spirit of a
high-souled woman, to whom her husband's honour was dear as his life,
she calls on him to perform all that his duty as a brave knight, and his

the motto of French chivalry, "mourir plut&ocirc;t que trahir son devoir;"
then suddenly breaking off, with a graceful and wife-like modesty, she
wonders at her own presumption thus to address her lord, her husband,
the son of a race of heroes,&mdash;</p>

<p>Clotilde became a mother before the return of her husband; and the
delicious moment in which she first placed her infant in his father's
arms, suggested the verses she has entitled "Ballade &agrave; mon &eacute;poux, lors,
quand tournait apr&egrave;s un an d'absence, mis en ses bras notre fils
enfan&ccedil;on."</p>

<p>The pretty burthen of this little ballad has often been quoted.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Faut &ecirc;tre deux pour avoir du plaisir,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Plaisir ne l'est qu'autant qu'on le partage!<br /></span>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p><p>But, says the mother,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2"><i>Un tiers</i> si doux ne fait tort &agrave; plaisir?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and should her husband be again torn from her, she will console herself
in his absence, by teaching her boy to lisp his father's name.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Gentil &eacute;poux! si Mars et ton courage<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Among some other little poems, which place the conjugal and maternal
character of Clotilde in a most charming light, I must notice one more
for its tender and heartfelt beauty. It is entitled "Ballade &agrave; mon
premier n&eacute;," and is addressed to her child, apparently in the absence of
its father.</p>

<p>Along the margin of the original MS. of this poem, was written an
additional stanza, in the same hand, and quite worthy of the rest.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Voil&agrave; ses traits ... son air ... voil&agrave; tout ce que j'aime!<br /></span>

<p>This is beautiful and true; beautiful, because it is true. There is
nothing of fancy nor of art, the intense feeling gushes, warm and
strong, from the heart of the writer, and it comes home to the heart of
the reader, filling it with sweetness.&mdash;Am I wrong in supposing that the
occasional obscurity of the old French will not disguise the beauty of
the sentiment from the young wife or mother, whose eye may glance over
this page?</p>

<p>It is painful, it is pitiful, to draw the veil of death and sorrow over
this sweet picture.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>De Surville closed his brief career of happiness and glory (and what
more than these could he have asked of heaven?) at the seige of Orleans,
where he fought under the banner of Joan of Arc.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> He was a gallant
and a loyal knight; so were hundreds of others who then strewed the
desolated fields of France: and De Surville had fallen undistinguished
amid the general havoc of all that was noble and brave, if the love and
genius of his wife had not immortalised him.</p>

<p>Clotilde, after her loss, resided in the ch&acirc;teau of her husband, in the
Lyonnois, devoting herself to literature and the education of her son:
and it is very remarkable, considering the times in which she lived,
that she neither married again, nor entered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> a religious house. The fame
of her poetical talents, which she continued to cultivate in her
retirement, rendered her, at length, an object of celebrity and
interest. The Duke of Orleans happened one day to repeat some of her
verses to Margaret of Scotland, the first wife of Louis the Eleventh;
and that accomplished patroness of poetry and poets wrote her an
invitation to attend her at court, which Clotilde modestly declined. The
Queen then sent her, as a token of her admiration and friendship, a
wreath of laurel, surmounted with a bouquet of daisies, (Margu&egrave;rites, in
allusion to the name of both,) the leaves of which were wrought in
silver and the flowers in gold, with this inscription: "Margu&egrave;rite
d'Ecosse &agrave; Margu&egrave;rite d'Helicon." We are told that Alain Chartier,
envious perhaps of these distinctions, wrote a satirical <i>quatrain</i>, in
which he accused Clotilde of being deficient in <i>l'air de cour</i>, and
that she replied to him, and defended herself in a very spirited
<i>rondeau</i>. Nothing more is known of the life of this interesting woman,
but that she had the misfortune to survive her son as well as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span> her
husband; and dying at the advanced age of ninety, in 1495, she was
buried with them in the same tomb.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>CONJUGAL POETRY CONTINUED.</h3>

<h3>VITTORIA COLONNA.</h3>


<p>Half a century later, we find the name of an Italian poetess, as
interesting as our Clotilde de Surville, and far more illustrious.
Vittoria Colonna was not thrown, with all her eminent gifts and
captivating graces, among a rude people in a rude age; but all
favourable influences, of time and circumstances, and fortune,
conspired, with native talent, to make her as celebrated as she was
truly admirable. She was the wife of that Marquis of Pescara, who has
earned himself a name in the busiest and bloodiest page of history:&mdash;of
that Pescara who commanded the armies of Charles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> the Fifth in Italy,
and won the battle of Pavia, where Francis the First was taken prisoner.
But great as was Pescara as a statesman and a military commander, he is
far more interesting as the husband of Vittoria Colonna, and the laurels
he reaped in the battle-field, are perishable and worthless, compared to
those which his admirable wife wreathed around his brow. So thought
Ariosto; who tell us, that if Alexander envied Achilles the fame he had
acquired in the songs of Homer, how much more had he envied Pescara
those strains in which his gifted consort had exalted his fame above
that of all contemporary heroes? and not only rendered herself immortal;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Col dolce stil, di che il miglior non odo,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ma pu&ograve; qualunque, di cui parli o scriva<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Trar dal sepolcro, e fa ch'eterno viva.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He prefers her to Artemisia, for a reason rather quaintly expressed,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i21">&mdash;&mdash;Anzi<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Tanto maggior, quanto &egrave; pi&ugrave; assai beli' opra,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Che por sotterra un uom, trarlo di sopra.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></div></div>

<p>"So much more praise it is, to raise a man above the earth, than to bury
him under it." He compares her successively to all the famed heroines of
Greece and Rome,&mdash;to Laodamia, to Portia, to Arria, to Argia, to
Evadne,&mdash;who died with or for their husbands; and concludes,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Quanto onore a Vittoria &egrave; pi&ugrave; dovuto<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Che di Lete, e del Rio che nove volte<br /></span>
<span class="i2">L'ombre circonda, ha tratto il suo consorte,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Malgrado delle parche, e della morte.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In fact, at a period when Italy could boast of a constellation of female
talent, such as never before or since adorned any one country at the
same time, and besides a number of women accomplished in languages,
philosophy, and the abstruser branches of learning, reckoned sixty
poetesses, nearly contemporary, there was not one to be compared with
Vittoria Colonna,&mdash;herself the theme of song; and upon whom her
enthusiastic countrymen have lavished all the high-sounding superlatives
of a language, so rich in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> expressive and sonorous epithets, that it
seems to multiply fame and magnify praise. We find Vittoria designated
in Italian biography, as <i>Diva</i>, divina, maravigliosa, elettissima,
illustrissima, virtuosissima, dottissima, castissima, gloriosissima, &amp;c.</p>

<p>But immortality on earth, as in heaven, must be purchased at a certain
price; and Vittoria, rich in all the gifts which heaven, and nature, and
fortune combined, ever lavished on one of her sex, paid for her
celebrity with her happiness: for thus it has ever been, and must ever
be, in this world of ours, "o&ugrave; les plus belles choses ont le pire
destin."</p>

<p>Her descent was illustrious on both sides. She was the daughter of the
Grand Constable Fabrizio Colonna, and of Anna di Montefeltro, daughter
of the Duke of Urbino, and was born about 1490. At four years old she
was destined to seal the friendship which existed between her own family
and that of d'Avalo, by a union with the young Count d'Avalo, afterwards
Marquis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> of Pescara, who was exactly her own age. Such infant marriages
are contracted at a fearful risk; yet, if auspicious, the habit of
loving from an early age, and the feeling of settled appropriation,
prevents the affections from wandering, and plant a mutual happiness
upon a foundation much surer than that of fancy or impulse. It was so in
this instance,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Conforme era l'etate<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ma 'l pensier pi&ugrave; conforme.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Vittoria, from her childish years, displayed the most extraordinary
talents, combined with all the personal charms and sweet proprieties
more characteristic of her sex. When not more than fifteen or sixteen,
she was already distinguished among her countrywomen, and sought even by
sovereign princes. The Duke of Savoy and the Duke of Braganza made
overtures to obtain her hand; the Pope himself interfered in behalf of
one of these princes; but both were rejected. Vittoria, accustomed to
consider herself as the destined bride of young d'Avalo, cultivated for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
him alone those talents and graces which others admired and coveted, and
resolved to wait till her youthful lover was old enough to demand the
ratification of their infant vows. She says of herself,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Appena avean gli spirti intera vita,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Quando il mio cor proscrisse ogn' altro oggetto.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Pescara had not the studious habits or literary talents of his betrothed
bride; but his beauty of person, his martial accomplishments, and his
brave and noble nature, were precisely calculated to impress her
poetical imagination, as contrasted with her own gentler and more
contemplative character. He loved her too with the most enthusiastic
adoration; he even prevailed on their mutual parents to anticipate the
period fixed for their nuptials; and at the age of seventeen they were
solemnly united.</p>

<p>The first four years after their marriage were chiefly spent in a
delightful retreat in the island of Ischia, where Pescara had a palace
and domain. Here, far from the world, and devoted to each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> other, and to
the most elegant pursuits, they seem to have revelled in such bliss as
poets fancy and romancers feign. Hence the frequent allusions to the
island of Ischia, in Vittoria's later poems, as a spot beloved by her
husband, and the scene of their youthful happiness. One thing alone was
wanting to complete this happiness: Heaven denied them children. She
laments this disappointment in the 22d Sonnet, where she says, that
"since she may not be the mother of sons, who shall inherit their
father's glory, yet she will at least, by uniting her name with his in
verse, become the mother of his illustrious deeds and lofty fame."</p>

<p>Pescara, whose active and martial genius led him to take a conspicuous
part in the wars which then agitated Italy, at length quitted his wife
to join the army of the Emperor. Vittoria, with tears, resigned him to
his duties. On his departure she presented him with many tokens of love,
and among the rest, with a banner, and a dressing-gown richly
embroidered; on the latter she had worked with her own hand, in silken
characters,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> the motto, "Nunquam minus otiosus quam cum otiosus
erat."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> She also presented him with some branches of palm, "In segno
di felice augurio;" but her bright anticipations were at first cruelly
disappointed. Pescara, then in his twenty-second year, commanded as
general of cavalry at the battle of Ravenna, where he was taken
prisoner, and detained at Milan. While in confinement, he amused his
solitude by showing his Vittoria that he had not forgotten their mutual
studies and early happiness at Ischia. He composed an essay or dialogue
on Love, which he addressed to her; and which, we are told, was
remarkable for its eloquence and spirit as a composition, as well as for
the most high-toned delicacy of sentiment. He was not liberated till the
following year.</p>

<p>Vittoria had taken for her <i>devise</i>, such was the fashion of the day, a
little Cupid within a circle formed by a serpent, with the motto, "Quem
peperit virtus prudentia servet amorem,"&mdash;"The love which virtue
inspired, discretion shall guard;" and during her husband's absence,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
she lived in retirement, principally in her loved retreat in the island
of Ischia, devoting her time to literature, and to the composition of
those beautiful Sonnets in which she celebrated the exploits and virtues
of her husband. He, whenever his military or political duties allowed of
a short absence from the theatre of war, flew to rejoin her; and these
short and delicious meetings, and the continual dangers to which he was
exposed, seem to have kept alive, through many long years, all the
romance and fervour of their early love. In the 79th Sonnet, Vittoria so
beautifully alludes to one of these meetings, that I am tempted to
extract it, in preference to others better known, and by many esteemed
superior as compositions.</p>

<p>This description of her husband returning, loaded with spoils and
honours;&mdash;of her fond admiration, mingled with a feminine awe, of his
warlike demeanor;&mdash;of his yielding, half reluctant, to her tender
entreaties, and showing her the wounds he had received in battle;&mdash;then
the bitter thoughts of his danger and absence, mingling with, and
interrupting these delicious recollections of happiness,&mdash;are all as
true to feeling as they are beautiful in poetry.</p>

<p>After a short career of glory, Pescara was at length appointed
commander-in-chief of the Imperial armies, and gained the memorable
battle of Pavia. Feared by his enemies, and adored by his soldiers, his
power was at this time so great, that many attempts were made to shake
his fidelity to the Emperor. Even the kingdom of Naples was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> offered to
him if he would detach himself from the party of Charles the Fifth.
Pescara was not without ambition, though without "the ill that should
attend it." He wavered&mdash;he consulted his wife;&mdash;he expressed his wish to
place her on a throne she was so fitted to adorn. That admirable and
high-minded woman wrote to confirm him in the path of honour, and
besought him not to sell his faith and truth, and his loyalty to the
cause in which he had embarked, for a kingdom. "For me," she said,
"believe that I do not desire to be the wife of a King; I am more proud
to be the wife of that great captain, who in war, by his valour, and in
peace, by his magnanimity, has vanquished the greatest monarchs."<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>On receiving this letter, Pescara hastened to shake off the subtle
tempters round him; but he had previously become so far entangled, that
he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> did not escape without some impeachment of his before stainless
honour. The bitter consciousness of this, and the effects of some
desperate wounds he had received at the battle of Pavia, which broke out
afresh, put a period to his life at Milan, in his thirty-fifth year.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>The Marchesana was at Naples when the news of his danger arrived. She
immediately set out to join him; but was met at Viterbo by a courier,
bearing the tidings of his death. On hearing this intelligence, she
fainted away; and being brought a little to herself, sank into a stupor
of grief, which alarmed her attendants for her reason or her life.
Seasonable tears at length came to her relief; but her sorrow, for a
long, long time, admitted no alleviation. She retired, after her first
overwhelming anguish had subsided, to her favourite residence in the
isle of Ischia, where she spent, almost uninterruptedly, the first seven
years of her widowhood.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>
<p>Being only in her thirty-fifth year, in the prime of her life and
beauty, and splendidly dowered, it was supposed that she would marry
again, and many of the Princes of Italy sought her hand; her brothers
urged it; but she replied to their entreaties and remonstrances, with a
mixture of dignity and tenderness, that "Though her noble husband might
be by others reputed dead, he still lived to her, and to her heart."<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
And in one of her poems, she alludes to these attempts to shake her
constancy. "I will preserve," she says, "the title of a faithful wife to
my beloved,&mdash;a title dear to me beyond every other: and on this
island-rock,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> once so dear to <i>him</i>, will I wait patiently, till time
brings the end of all my griefs, as once of all my joys."</p>

</div></div>

<p>This Sonnet was written in the seventh year of her widowhood. She says
elsewhere, that her heart having once been so nobly bestowed, disdains a
meaner chain; and that her love had not ceased with the death of its
object.&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Di cosi nobil fiamma amore mi cinse,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ch' essendo spenta, in me viva l' ardore.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is another, addressed to the poet Molza, in which she alludes to
the fate of his parents, who, by a singular providence, both expired in
the same day and hour: such a fate appeared to her worthy of envy; and
she laments very tenderly that Heaven had doomed her to survive him with
whom her heart lay buried. There are others addressed to Cardinal Bembo,
in which she thus excuses herself for making Pescara the subject of her
verse.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Scrivo sol per sfogar l' interna doglia;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">La pura fe, l' ardor, l' intensa pena<br /></span>

<span class="i4">E tal, che tempo, ne raggion l' affrena.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is also a Canzone by Vittoria, full of poetry and feeling, in
which she alludes to the loss of that beauty which once she was proud to
possess, because it was dear in her husband's sight. "Look down upon
me," she exclaims, "from thy seat of glory! look down upon me with those
eyes that ever turned with tenderness on mine! Behold, how misery has
changed me; how all that once was beauty is fled!&mdash;and yet I am&mdash;I am
the same!"&mdash;(Io son&mdash;io son ben dessa!)&mdash;But no translation&mdash;none at
least that I could execute&mdash;would do justice to the deep pathos, the
feminine feeling, and the eloquent simplicity of this beautiful and
celebrated poem. The reader will find it in Mathias's collection.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>After the lapse of several years, her mind, elevated by the very nature
of her grief, took a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> strong devotional turn: and from this time, we
find her poetry entirely consecrated to sacred subjects.</p>

<p>The first of these <i>Rime spirituali</i> is exquisitely beautiful. She
allows that the anguish she had felt on the death of her noble husband,
was not alleviated, but rather nourished and kept alive in all its first
poignancy, by constantly dwelling on the theme of his virtues and her
own regrets; that the thirst of fame, and the possession of glory, could
not cure the pining sickness of her heart; and that she now turned to
Heaven as a last and best resource against sorrow.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

</div></div>

<p>Not the least of Vittoria's titles to fame, was the intense adoration
with which she inspired Michel Angelo. Condivi says he was enamoured of
her divine talents. "In particolare egli am&ograve; grandemente la Marchesana
di Pescara, del cui divino spirito era inamorato:" and he makes use of a
strong expression to describe the admiration and friendship she felt for
him in return. She was fifteen years younger than Michel Angelo, who not
only employed his pencil and his chisel for her pleasure, or at her
suggestion, but has left among his poems several which are addressed to
her, and which breathe that deep and fervent, yet pure and reverential
love she was as worthy to inspire as he was to feel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>I cannot refuse myself the pleasure of adding here one of the Sonnets,
addressed by Michel Angelo to the Marchesana of Pescara, as translated
by Wordsworth, in a peal of grand harmony, almost as <i>literally</i>
faithful to the expression as to the spirit of the original.</p>


<h4>SONNET.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Yes! hope may with my strong desire keep pace,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And I be undeluded, unbetrayed;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For if of our affections none find grace<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In sight of Heaven, then, wherefore had God made<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The world which we inhabit? Better plea<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Glory to that eternal peace is paid,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">His hope is treacherous only whose love dies<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With beauty, which is varying every hour:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But, in chaste hearts, uninfluenced by the power<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of outward change, there blooms a deathless flower,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That breathes on earth the air of Paradise.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He stood by her in her last moments; and when her lofty and gentle
spirit had forsaken its fair<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> tenement, he raised her hand and kissed it
with a sacred respect. He afterwards expressed to an intimate friend his
regret, that being oppressed by the awful feelings of that moment, he
had not, for the first and last time, pressed his lips to hers.</p>

<p>Vittoria had another passionate admirer in Galeazzo di Tarsia, Count of
Belmonte in Calabria, and an excellent poet of that time.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> His
attachment was as poetical, but apparently not quite so Platonic, as
that of Michel Angelo. His beautiful Canzone beginning,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">A qual pietra sommiglia<br /></span>
<span class="i2">La mia bella Colonna,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>contains lines rather more impassioned than the modest and grave
Vittoria could have approved: for example&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Con lei foss' io da che si parte il sole,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">E non ci vedesse altri che le stelle,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">&mdash;Solo una notte&mdash;e mai non fosse l' Alba!<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>
<p>Marini and Bernardo Tasso were also numbered among her poets and
admirers.</p>

<p>Vittoria Colonna died at Rome, in 1547. She was suspected of favouring
in secret the reformed doctrines; but I do not know on what authority
Roscoe mentions this. Her noble birth, her admirable beauty, her
illustrious marriage, her splendid genius, (which made her the worship
of genius&mdash;and the theme of poets,) have rendered her one of the most
remarkable of women;&mdash;as her sorrows, her conjugal virtues, her
innocence of heart, and elegance of mind, have rendered her one of the
most interesting.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Where could she fix on mortal ground<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Those tender thoughts and high?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now peace, the woman's heart hath found,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And joy, the poet's eye!<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Antiquity may boast its heroines; but it required virtues of a higher
order to be a Vittoria Colonna, or a Lady Russel, than to be a Portia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
or an Arria. How much more graceful, and even more sublime, is the moral
strength, the silent enduring heroism of the Christian, than the stern,
impatient defiance of destiny, which showed so imposing in the heathen!
How much more difficult is it sometimes to live than to die!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Pi&ugrave; val d' ogni vittoria un bel soffirire.<br /></span>

<p>Or as Campbell has expressed nearly the same sentiment,</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>CONJUGAL POETRY CONTINUED.</h3>

<h3>VERONICA GAMBARA.</h3>


<p>Vittoria Colonna, and her famed friend and contemporary, Veronica,
Countess of Correggio, are inseparable names in the history of Italian
literature, as living at the same time, and equally ornaments of their
sex. They resembled each other in poetical talent, in their domestic
sorrows and conjugal virtues: in every other respect the contrast is
striking. Vittoria, with all her genius, seems to have been as lovely,
gentle, and feminine a creature as ever wore the form of woman.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">No lily&mdash;no&mdash;nor fragrant hyacinth,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Had half such softness, sweetness, blessedness.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Veronica, on the contrary, was one,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">&mdash;&mdash;to whose masculine spirit<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To touch the stars had seemed an easy flight.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She added to her talents and virtues, strong passions,&mdash;and happily also
sufficient energy of mind to govern and direct them. She had not
Vittoria's personal charms: it is said, that if her face had equalled
her form, she would have been one of the most beautiful women of her
time; but her features were irregular, and her grand commanding figure,
which in her youth was admired for its perfect proportions, grew large
and heavy as she advanced in life. She retained, however, to the last,
the animation of her countenance, the dignity of her deportment, and
powers of conversation so fascinating, that none ever approached her
without admiration, or quitted her society without regret.</p>

<p>Her verses have not the polished harmony and the graceful suavity of
Vittoria's; but more vigour of expression, and more vivacity of
colouring. Their defects were equally opposed:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span> the simplicity of
Veronica sometimes borders upon harshness and carelessness; the uniform
sweetness of Vittoria is sometimes too elaborate and artificial.</p>

<p>Veronica Gambara was born in 1485. Her <i>fortunate</i> parents, as her
biographer expresses it,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> were Count Gian Francisco Gambara, and Alda
Pia. In her twenty-fifth year, when already distinguished as a poetess,
and a woman of great and various learning, she married Ghiberto Count of
Correggio, to whom she appears to have been attached with all the
enthusiasm of her character, and by whom she was tenderly loved in
return. After the birth of her second son, she was seized with a
dangerous disorder, of what nature we are not told. The physicians
informed her husband that they did not despair of her recovery, but that
the remedies they should be forced to employ would probably preclude all
hope of her becoming again a mother. The Count, who had always wished
for a numerous offspring, ordered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> them to employ these remedies
instantly, and save her to him at every other risk. She recovered; but
the effects upon her constitution were such as had been predicted.</p>

<p>Like Vittoria Colonna, she made the personal qualities and renown of her
husband the principal subjects of her verse. She dwells particularly on
his fine dark eyes, expressing very gracefully the various feelings they
excited in her heart, whether clouded with thought, or serene with
happiness, or sparkling with affection.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> She devotes six Sonnets and
a Madrigal to this subject; and if we may believe his poetical and
admiring wife, these "occhi stellante" could combine more variety of
expression in a single glance than ever did eyes before or since.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Lieti, mesti, superbi, umili, altieri,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Vi mostrate in un punto; onde di speme<br /></span>
<span class="i2">E di timor m' empiete.&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>
<p>There is great power and pathos in one of her poems, written on his
absence.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">O Stella! O Fato! del mio mal si avaro!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ch' l mio ben m'allontani, anzi m'involi&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fia mai quel di ch' io lo riveggia o mora?<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Veronica lost her husband, after nine years of the happiest union.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
He gave her an incontrovertible proof of his attachment and boundless
confidence, by leaving her his sole executrix, with the government of
Correggio, and the guardianship of his children during their minority.
Her grief on this occasion threw her into a dangerous and protracted
fever, which during the rest of her life attacked her periodically. She
says in one of her poems, that nothing but the fear of not meeting her
beloved husband in Paradise prevented her from dying with him. She not
only vowed herself to a perpetual widowhood, but to a perpetual
mourning; and the extreme vivacity of her imagination was displayed in
the strange<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span> trappings of woe with which she was henceforth surrounded.
She lived in apartments hung and furnished with black, and from which
every object of luxury was banished: her liveries, her coach, her
horses, were of the same funereal hue. There is extant a curious letter
addressed by her to Ludovico Rossi, in which she entreats her dear
Messer Ludovico, by all their mutual friendship, to procure, at any
price, a certain black horse, to complete her set of carriage
horses&mdash;"pi&ugrave; che notte oscuri, conformi, proprio a miei travagli." Over
the door of her sleeping-room she inscribed the distich which Virgil has
put into the mouth of Dido.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Ille meos, primus qui me sibi junxit, amores<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Abstulit: ille habeat secum servetque sepulchro!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">He who once had my vows, shall ever have,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Beloved on earth and worshipped in the grave!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But, unlike Dido, she did not "profess too much." She kept her word.
Neither did she neglect her duties; but more fortunate in one respect
than her fair and elegant friend the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span> Marchesana, she had two sons, to
whose education she paid the utmost attention, while she administered
the government of Correggio with equal firmness and gentleness. Her
husband had left a daughter,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> whom she educated and married with a
noble dower. Her eldest son, Hypolito, became a celebrated military
commander; her youngest and favourite son, Girolamo, was created a
cardinal. Wherever Veronica loved, it seems to have been with the same
passionate <i>abandon</i> which distinguished her character in every thing.
Writing to a friend to recommend her son to his kind offices, she
assures him that "he (her son) is not only a part of herself&mdash;but rather
<i>herself</i>. Remember," she says, "Ch'egli &egrave; la Veronica medesima,"&mdash;a
strong and tender expression.</p>

<p>We find her in correspondence with all the most illustrious characters,
political and literary, of that time; and chiefly with Ariosto, Bembo,
Molza, Sanazzaro, and Vittoria Colonna. Ariosto<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> has paid her an elegant
compliment in the last canto of the Orlando Furioso. She is one among
the company of beautiful and accomplished women and noble knights, who
hail the poet, at the conclusion of his work, as a long-travelled
mariner is welcomed to the shore:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Veronica da Gambara e con loro<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Si grata a Febo, e al santo aonio coro.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This was distinction enough to immortalize her, if she had not already
immortalized herself.</p>

<p>Veronica was not a prolific poetess; but the few Sonnets she has left,
have a vigour, a truth and simplicity, not often met with among the
<i>rimatori</i> of that rhyming age. She has written fewer good poems than
Vittoria Colonna, but among them, two which are reckoned superior to
Vittoria's best,&mdash;one addressed to the rival monarchs, Charles the Fifth
and Francis the First, exhorting them to give peace to Italy, and unite
their forces to protect civilized Europe from the incursions of the
infidels; the other, which is exquisitely tender and picturesque, was
composed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> on revisiting her native place Brescia, after the death of her
husband.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Poi che per mia ventura a veder torno, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It may be found in the collection of Mathias.</p>

<p>Veronica da Gambara died in 1550, and was buried by her husband.</p>

<p>It should seem that poetical talents and conjugal truth and tenderness
were inherent in the family of Veronica. Her niece, Camilla Valentini,
the authoress of some very sweet poems, which are to be found in various
<i>Scelte</i>, married the Count del Verme, who died after a union of several
years. She had flung herself, in a transport of grief, on the body of
her husband; and when her attendants attempted to remove her, they found
her&mdash;dead! Even in that moment of anguish her heart had broken.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">O judge her gently, who so deeply loved!<br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Her</i>, who in reason's spite, without a crime,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Was in a trance of passion thus removed!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I have been detained too long in "the sweet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> South;" yet, before we quit
it for the present, I must allude to one or two names which cannot be
entirely passed over, as belonging to the period of which we have been
speaking&mdash;the golden age of Italy and of literature.</p>

<p>Bernardino Rota, who died in 1575, a poet of considerable power and
pathos, has left a volume of poems, "In vita e in morte di Porzia
Capece;" she was a beautiful woman of Naples, whom he loved and
afterwards married, and who was snatched from him in the pride of her
youth and beauty. Among his Sonnets, I find one peculiarly striking,
though far from being the best. The picture it presents, with all its
affecting accompaniments, and the feelings commemorated, are obviously
taken from nature and reality. The poet&mdash;the husband&mdash;approaches to
contemplate the lifeless form of his Portia, and weeping, he draws from
her pale cold hand the nuptial ring, which he had himself placed on her
finger with all the fond anticipations of love and hope&mdash;the pledge of a
union which death alone could dissolve: and now, with a breaking heart,
he transfers it to his own. Such is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> subject of this striking poem,
which, with some few faults against taste, is still singularly
picturesque and eloquent, particularly the last six lines.&mdash;</p>

<p>Castiglione, besides being celebrated as the finest gentleman of his
day, and the author of that code of all noble and knightly
accomplishments, of perfect courtesy and gentle bearing&mdash;"Il
Cortigiano," must have a place among our conjugal poets. He had married
in 1516, Hypolita di Torrello, whose accomplishments, beauty, and
illustrious birth, rendered her worthy of him. It appears, however, that
her family, who were of Mantua, could not bear to part with her,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> and
that after her marriage, she remained in that city, while Castiglione
was ambassador at Rome. This separation gave rise to a very impassioned
correspondence;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> and the tender regrets and remonstrances scattered
through her letters, he transposed into a very beautiful poem, in the
form of an epistle from his wife. It may be found in the appendix to
Roscoe's Leo X. (No. 196.) Hypolita died in giving birth to a daughter,
after a union of little more than three years, and left Castiglione for
some time inconsolable. We are particularly told of the sympathy of the
Pope and the Cardinals on this occasion, and that Leo condoled with him
in a manner equally unusual and substantial, by bestowing on him
immediately a pension of two hundred gold crowns.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>CONJUGAL POETRY CONTINUED.</h3>

<h3>STORY OF DR. DONNE AND HIS WIFE.</h3>


<p>My next instance of conjugal poetry is taken from the literary history
of our own country, and founded on as true and touching a piece of
romance as ever was taken from the page of real life.</p>

<p>Dr. Donne, once so celebrated as a writer, now so neglected, is more
interesting for his matrimonial history, and for one little poem
addressed to his wife, than for all his learned, metaphysical, and
theological productions. As a poet, it is probable that even readers of
poetry know little of him, except from the lines at the bottom of the
pages in Pope's version, or rather translation, of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> his Satires, the
very recollection of which is enough to "set one's ears on edge," and
verify Coleridge's witty and imitative couplet.&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Donne&mdash;whose muse on dromedary trots,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Twists iron pokers into true love knots.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is this inconceivable harshness of versification, which has caused
Donne to be so little read, except by those who make our old poetry
their study. One of these critics has truly observed, that "there is
scarce a writer in our language who has so thoroughly mixed up the good
and the bad together." What is good, is the result of truth, of passion,
of a strong mind, and a brilliant wit: what is bad, is the effect of a
most perverse taste, and total want of harmony. No sooner has he kindled
the fancy with a splendid thought, than it is as instantly quenched in a
cloud of cold and obscure conceits: no sooner has he touched the heart
with a feeling or sentiment, true to nature and powerfully expressed,
than we are chilled or disgusted by pedantry or coarseness.</p>

<p>The events of Donne's various life, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span> romantic love he inspired
and felt, make us recur to his works, with an interest and a curiosity,
which while they give a value to every beauty we can discover, render
his faults more glaring,&mdash;more provoking,&mdash;more intolerable.</p>

<p>In his youth he lavished a considerable fortune in dissipation, in
travelling, and, it may be added, in the acquisition of great and
various learning. He then entered the service of Lord Chancellor
Ellesmere, as secretary. Under the same roof resided Lady Ellesmere's
niece, Anne Moore, a lovely and amiable woman. She was about nineteen,
and Donne was about thirty, handsome, lively, and polished by travel and
study. They met constantly, and the result was a mutual attachment of
the most ardent and romantic character. As they were continually
together, and always in presence of watchful relations ("ambushed round
with household spies," as he expresses it,) it could not long be
concealed. "The friends of both parties," says Walton, "used much
diligence and many arguments to kill or cool their affections for each
other, but in vain:"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span> and the lady's father, Sir George Moore, "knowing
prevention to be the best part of wisdom," came up to town in all haste,
and carried off his daughter into the country. But his preventive wisdom
came too late: the lovers had been secretly married three weeks before.</p>

<p>This precipitate step was perhaps excusable, from the known violence and
sternness of Sir George's character. His daughter was well aware that
his consent would never be voluntary: she preferred marrying without it,
to marrying against it; and trusted to obtain his forgiveness when there
was no remedy:&mdash;a common mode of reasoning, I believe, in such cases.
Never perhaps was a youthful error of this description more bitterly
punished&mdash;more deeply expiated&mdash;and so little repented of!</p>

<p>The Earl of Northumberland undertook to break the matter to Sir George,
to reason with him on the subject; and to represent the excellent
qualities of his son-in-law, and the duty of forgiveness, as a wise man,
a father, and Christian. His intention was benevolent, and we have
reason<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span> to regret that his speech or letter has not been preserved; for
(such is human inconsistency!) this very Earl of Northumberland never
could forgive his own daughter a similar disobedience,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> but followed
it with his curse, which he was with difficulty prevailed on to retract.
His mediation failed: Sir George, on learning that his precautions came
too late, burst into a transport of rage, the effect of which resembled
insanity. He had sufficient interest in the arbitrary court of James, to
procure the imprisonment of Donne and the witnesses of his daughter's
marriage; and he insisted that his brother-in-law should dismiss the
young man from his office,&mdash;his only support. Lord Ellesmere yielded
with extreme reluctance, saying, "he parted with such a friend and such
a secretary, as were a fitter servant for a King." Donne, in sending
this news to his wife, signs his name with the quaint oddity, which was
so characteristic of his mind,&mdash;<i>John Donne, Anne Donne,&mdash;undone</i>:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> and
<i>undone</i> they truly were. As soon as he was released he claimed his
wife; but it was many months before they were allowed to meet.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Have we for this kept guard, like spy o'er spy?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Had correspondence whilst the foe stood by?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Stolen (more to sweeten them) our many blisses<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of meetings, conference, embracements, kisses?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Shadow'd with negligence our best respects?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Varied our language through all dialects<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of becks, winks, looks; and often under boards,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Spoke dialogues, with our feet far from our words?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And after all this passed purgatory,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Must sad divorce make us the vulgar story?<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At length this unkind father in some degree relented; he suffered his
daughter and her husband to live together, but he refused to contribute
to their support; and they were reduced to the greatest distress. Donne
had nothing. "His wife had been curiously and plentifully educated; both
their natures generous, accustomed to confer, not to receive
courtesies;" and when he looked on her who was to be the partner of his
lot, he was filled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span> with such sadness and apprehension as he could never
have felt for himself alone.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>In this situation they were invited into the house of a generous kinsman
(Sir Francis Woolley), who maintained them and their increasing family
for several years, "to their mutual content" and undiminished
friendship.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Volumes could not say more in praise of both than this
singular connection:&mdash;to bestow favours, so long continued and of such
magnitude, with a grace which made them sit lightly on those who
received them, and to preserve, under the weight of such obligation,
dignity, independence, and happiness, bespeaks uncommon greatness of
spirit and goodness of heart and temper on all sides.</p>

<p>This close and domestic intimacy was dissolved only by the death of Sir
Francis, who had previously procured a kind of reconcilement with the
father of Mrs. Donne, and an allowance of about eighty pounds a year.
They fell again into debt,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span> and into misery; and "doubtless," says old
Walton, with a quaint, yet eloquent simplicity, "their marriage had been
attended with a heavy repentance, if God had not blessed them with so
mutual and cordial affections, as, in the midst of their sufferings,
made their bread of sorrow taste more pleasantly than the banquets of
dull and low-spirited<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> people." We find in some of Donne's letters,
the most heart-rending pictures of family distress, mingled with the
tenderest touches of devoted affection for his amiable wife. "I write,"
he says, "from the fire-side in my parlour, and in the noise of three
gamesome children, and by the side of her, whom, because I have
transplanted into a wretched fortune, I must labour to disguise that
from her by all such honest devices, as giving her my company and
discourse," &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>And in another letter he describes himself, with all his family sick,
his wife stupified by her own and her children's sufferings, without
money to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span> purchase medicine,&mdash;"and if God should ease us with burials, I
know not how to perform even that; but I flatter myself that I am dying
too, for I cannot waste faster than by such griefs.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&mdash;From my hospital.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<span class="smcap">John Donne.</span>"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is the language of despair; but love was stronger than despair, and
supported this affectionate couple through all their trials. Add to
mutual love the spirit of high honour and conscious desert; for in the
midst of this sad, and almost sordid misery and penury, Donne, whose
talents his contemporaries acknowledged with admiration, refused to take
orders and accept a benefice, from a scruple of conscience, on account
of the irregular life he had led in his youthful years.</p>

<p>But in their extremity, Providence raised them up another munificent
friend. Sir Robert Drury received the whole family into his house,
treated Donne with the most cordial respect and affection, and some time
afterwards invited him to accompany him abroad.</p>

<p>Donne had been married to his wife seven years, during which they had
suffered every variety of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> wretchedness, except the greatest of
all,&mdash;that of being separated. The idea of this first parting was beyond
her fortitude; she said, her "divining soul boded her some ill in his
absence," and with tears she entreated him not to leave her. Her
affectionate husband yielded; but Sir Robert Drury was urgent, and would
not be refused. Donne represented to his wife all that honour and
gratitude required of him; and she, too really tender, and too devoted
to be selfish and unreasonable, yielded with "an unwilling willingness;"
yet, womanlike, she thought she could not bear a pain she had never
tried, and was seized with the romantic idea of following him in the
disguise of a page.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> In a delicate and amiable woman, and a mother,
it could have been but a momentary thought, suggested in the frenzy of
anguish. It inspired, however, the following beautiful dissuasion, which
her husband addressed to her.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">A blushing, womanly, discovering grace.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When I am gone dream me some happiness,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Openly love's force; nor in bed fright thy nurse<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With midnight starlings, crying out, Oh! oh!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nurse, oh! my love is slain! I saw him go<br /></span>
<span class="i2">O'er the white Alps alone; I saw him, I,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Assailed, ta'en, fight, stabb'd, bleed, fall, and die!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Augur me better chance, except dread Jove<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Think it enough for me to have had thy love.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I would not have the heart of one who could read these lines, and think
only of their rugged style, and faults of taste and expression. The
superior power of truth and sentiment have immortalised this little
poem, and the occasion which gave it birth. The wife and husband parted,
and he left with her another little poem, which he calls a "Valediction,
forbidding to mourn."</p>

<p>When Donne was at Paris, and still suffering under the grief of this
separation, he saw, or fancied he saw, the apparition of his wife pass
through the room in which he sat, her hair dishevelled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> and hanging down
upon her shoulders, her face pale and mournful, and carrying in her arms
a dead infant. Sir Robert Drury found him a few minutes afterwards in
such a state of horror, and his mind so impressed with the reality of
this vision, that an express was immediately sent off to England, to
inquire after the health of Mrs. Donne. She had been seized, after the
departure of her husband, with a premature confinement; had been at the
point of death; but was then out of danger, and recovering.</p>

<p>This incident has been related by all Donne's biographers, by some with
infinite solemnity, by others with sneering incredulity. I can speak
from experience, of the power of the imagination to impress us with a
palpable sense of what is <i>not</i>, and cannot be; and it seems to me that,
in a man of Donne's ardent, melancholy temperament, brooding day and
night on the one sad idea, a high state of nervous excitement is
sufficient to account for this impression, without having recourse to
supernatural agency, or absolute disbelief.</p>

<p>Donne, after several years of study, was prevailed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span> on to enter holy
orders; and about four years afterwards, his amiable wife died in her
twelfth confinement.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> His grief was so overwhelming, that his old
friend Walton thinks it necessary thus to apologise for him:&mdash;"Nor is it
hard to think (being that passions may be both changed and heightened by
accidents,) but that the abundant affection which was once betwixt him
and her, who had so long been the delight of his eyes and the companion
of his youth; her, with whom he had divided so many pleasant sorrows and
contented fears, as common people are not capable of, should be changed
into a commensurable grief." He roused himself at length to his duties;
and preaching his first sermon at St. Clement's Church, in the Strand,
where his beloved wife lay buried, he took for his text, Jer. iii. v.
1,&mdash;"Lo! I am the man that hath seen affliction;" and sent all his
congregation home in tears.</p>

<p>Among Donne's earlier poetry may be distinguished the following little
song, which has so much more harmony and elegance than his other pieces,
that it is scarcely a fair specimen of his style. It was long popular,
and I can remember when a child, hearing it sung to very beautiful
music.</p>

of his patron and friend, Sir Robert Drury. She was the richest heiress
in England, the wealth of her father being considered almost
incalculable; and this, added to her singular beauty, and extraordinary
talents and acquirements, rendered her so popularly interesting, that
she was considered a fit match for Henry, Prince of Wales. She died in
her sixteenth year.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>CONJUGAL POETRY CONTINUED.</h3>

<h3>HABINGTON'S CASTARA.</h3>


<p>One of the most elegant monuments ever raised by genius to conjugal
affection, was Habington's Castara.</p>

<p>William Habington, who ranks among the most graceful of our old minor
poets, was a gentleman of an ancient Roman Catholic family in
Worcestershire, and born in 1605.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> On his return from his travels, he
saw and loved Lucy Herbert, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span> daughter of Lord Powis, and
grand-daughter of the Earl of Northumberland. She was far his superior
in birth, being descended, on both sides, from the noblest blood in
England; and her haughty relations at first opposed their union. It was,
however, merely that degree of opposition, without which the "course of
true love would have run <i>too</i> smooth." It was just sufficient to pique
the ardour of the lover, and prove the worth and constancy of her he
loved. The history of their attachment has none of the painful interest
which hangs round that of Donne and his wife: it is a picture of pure
and peaceful happiness, and of mutual tenderness, on which the
imagination dwells with a soft complacency and unalloyed pleasure; with
nothing of romance but what was borrowed from the elegant mind and
playful fancy, which heightened and embellished the delightful reality.</p>

<p>If Habington had not been born a poet, a tombstone in an obscure country
church would have been the only memorial of himself and his Castara.
"She it was who animated his imagination<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span> with tenderness and elegance,
and filled it with images of beauty, purified by her feminine delicacy
from all grosser alloy." In return, he may be allowed to exult in the
immortality he has given her.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Thy vows are heard! and thy Castara's name<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is writ as fair i' the register of fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As the ancient beauties which translated are<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By poets up to Heaven&mdash;each there a star.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">....*....*....*....*<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Fix'd in Love's firmament no star shall shine<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So nobly fair, so purely chaste as thine!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The collection of poems which Habington dedicated to his Castara, is
divided into two parts: those written before his marriage he has
entitled "The Mistress," those written subsequently, "The Wife."</p>

<p>He has prefixed to the whole an introduction in prose, written with some
quaintness, but more feeling and elegance, in which he claims for
himself the honour of being the first <i>conjugal</i> poet in our language.
To use his own words: "Though I appear to strive against the stream of
the best wits in erecting the same altar to chastity and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> love, I will,
for one, adventure to do well without a precedent."</p>

<p>Habington had, however, been anticipated, as we have seen, by some of
the Italian poets whom he has imitated: he has a little of the
<i>r&eacute;cherche</i> and affectation of their school, and is not untinctured by
the false taste of his day. He has not great power, nor much pathos; but
these defects are redeemed by a delicacy of expression uncommon at that
time; by the interest he has thrown round a love as pure as its object,
and by the most exquisite touches of fancy, sentiment, and tenderness.</p>

<p>Without expressly naming his wife in his prefatory remarks, he alludes
to her very beautifully, and exults, with a modest triumph, in the value
of his rich possession.</p>

<p>"How unhappy soever I may be in the elocution, I am sure the theme is
worthy enough. * * * Nor was my invention ever sinister from the
straight way of chastity; and when love builds upon <i>that</i> rock, it may
safely contemn the battery of the waves, and the threatenings of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
wind. Since time, that makes a mockery of the finest structures, shall
itself be ruined before <i>that</i> be demolished. Thus was the foundation
laid; and though my eye, in its survey, was satisfied even to curiosity,
yet did not my search rest there. The alabaster, ivory, porphyry, jet,
that lent an admirable beauty to the outward building, entertained me
with but half pleasure, since they stood there only to make sport for
ruin. But when my soul grew acquainted with the owner of that mansion, I
found that oratory was dumb when it began to speake her."</p>

<p>He then describes her wisdom; her wit; her innocence,&mdash;"so unvitiated by
conversation with the world, that the subtle-witted of her sex would
have termed it ignorance;" her modesty "so timorous, it represented a
besieged city standing watchfully on her guard: in a word, all those
virtues which should restore woman to her primitive state of virtue,
fully adorned her." He then prettily apologises for this indiscreet
rhetoric on such a subject. "Such," he says, "I fancied her; for to say
she is, or was such, were to play<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span> the merchant, and boast too much of
the value of the jewel I possess, but have no mind to part with."</p>

<p>He concludes with this just, yet modest appreciation of himself:&mdash;"If
not too indulgent to what is mine own, I think even these verses will
have that proportion in the world's opinion, that heaven hath allotted
me in fortune,&mdash;not so high as to be wondered at, nor so low as to be
contemned."</p>

<p>In the description of "the <span class="smcap">Mistress</span>," are some little touches inimitably
graceful and complimentary. Though couched in general terms, it is of
course a portrait of Lucy Herbert, such as she appeared to him in the
days of their courtship, and fondly recalled and dwelt upon, when she
had been many years a wife and a mother. He represents her "as fair as
Nature intended her, helpt, perhaps, to a more pleasing grace by the
sweetness of education, not by the sleight of art." This discrimination
is delicately drawn.&mdash;He continues, "she is young; for a woman, past the
delicacy of her spring, may well move to virtue by respect, never by
beauty to affection. In her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> carriage, sober, thinking her youth
expresseth life enough, without the giddy motion fashion of late hath
taken up."&mdash;(This was early in the reign of the grave and correct
Charles the First. What would Habington have said of the flaunting,
fluttering, voluble beauties of Charles the Second's time?)</p>

<p>He extols the melody of her voice, her knowledge of music, and her grace
in the dance: above all, he dwells on her retiring modesty, the
favourite theme of his praise in prose and verse, which seems to have
been the most striking part of her character, and her greatest charm in
the eyes of her lover. He concludes, with the beautiful sentiment I have
chosen as a motto to this little book.&mdash;"Only she, who hath as great a
share in virtue as in beauty, deserves a noble love to serve her, and a
free poesie to speak her!"</p>

<p>The poems are all short, generally in the form of <i>sonnets</i>, if that
name can be properly applied to all poems of fourteen lines, whatever
the rhythmical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> arrangement. The subjects of these, and their quaint
expressive titles, form a kind of chronicle of their loves, in which
every little incident is commemorated. Thus we have, "to Castara,
inquiring why I loved her."&mdash;"To Castara, softly singing to herself."
"To Castara, leaving him on the approach of night."&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">What should we fear, Castara? the cool air<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That's fallen in love, and wantons in thy hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Will not betray our whispers:&mdash;should I steal<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A nectar'd kiss, the wind dares not reveal<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The treasure I possess!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"To Castara, on being debarred her presence," (probably by her father,
Lord Powis.)&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Banish'd from you, I charged the nimble wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My unseen messenger, to speak my mind<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In amorous whispers to you!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Upon her intended journey into the country."&mdash;"Upon Seymors," (a house
near Marlow, where Castara resided with her parents, and where, it
appears, he was not allowed to visit her.)&mdash;"On<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> a trembling kiss she
had granted him on her departure." The commencement of this is
beautiful:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">The Arabian wind, whose breathing gently blows<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Purple to the violet, blushes to the rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Did never yield an odour such as this!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Why are you then so thrifty of a kiss,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Authorized even by custom? Why doth fear<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So tremble on your lip, my lip being near?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then we have, "to Castara, on visiting her in the night."&mdash;This alludes
to a meeting of the lovers, at a time they were debarred from each
other's society.</p>

<p>The following are more exquisitely graceful than any thing in Waller,
yet much in his style.</p>


<h4>TO ROSES IN THE BOSOM OF CASTARA.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Ye blushing virgins happy are<br /></span>
<span class="i4">In the chaste nunnery of her breast;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For he'd profane so chaste a fair<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Who e'er should call it Cupid's nest.<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Transplanted thus, how bright ye grow!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">How rich a perfume do ye yield!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In some close garden, cowslips so<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Are sweeter than i' the open field.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">In those white cloisters live secure,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">From the rude blasts of wanton breath;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Each hour more innocent and pure,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Till ye shall wither into death.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Then that which living gave ye room,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Your glorious sepulchre shall be;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">There needs no marble for a tomb,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">That breast hath marble been to me!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The epistle to Castara's mother, Lady Eleanor Powis, who appears to have
looked kindly on their love, contains some very beautiful lines, in
which he asserts the disinterestedness of his affection for Castara,
rich as she is in fortune, and derived from the blood of Charlemagne.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">My love is envious! would Castara were<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The daughter of some mountain cottager,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who, with his toil worn out, could dying leave<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Her no more dower than what she did receive<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
<span class="i2">From bounteous Nature; her would I then lead<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To the temple, rich in her own wealth; her head<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Crowned with her hair's fair treasure; diamonds in<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Her brighter eyes; soft ermines in her skin,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Each India in her cheek, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This first part closes with "the description of Castara," which is
extended to several stanzas, of unequal merit. The following compose in
themselves a sweet picture:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Like the violet, which alone<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Prospers in some happy shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My Castara lives unknown,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To no looser eye betray'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For she's to herself untrue<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who delights i' the public view.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">....*....*....*....*<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Such her beauty, as no arts<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Have enrich'd with borrow'd grace<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Her high birth no pride imparts,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">For she blushes in her place.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Folly boasts a glorious blood&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She is noblest, being good!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a>
</span><span class="i2">....*....*....*....*<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">She her throne makes reason climb,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">While wild passions captive lie;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And each article of time<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Her pure thoughts to heaven fly.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All her vows religious be&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And her love she vows to me!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The second part of these poems, dedicated to Castara as "the <span class="smcap">Wife</span>," have
not less variety and beauty, though there were, of course, fewer
incidents to record. The first Sonnet, "to Castara, now possest of her
in marriage," beginning "This day is ours," &amp;c. has more fancy and
poetry than tenderness. The lines to Lord Powis, the father of Castara,
on the same occasion, are more beautiful and earnest, yet rich in
fanciful imagery. Lord Powis, it must be remembered, had opposed their
union, and had been, with difficulty, induced to give his consent. The
following lines refer to this; and Habington asserts the purity and
unselfishness of his attachment.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Nor grieve, my Lord, 'tis perfected. Before<br /></span>

<span class="i2">On the highest ground of fortune,&mdash;the world known,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No greatness but what waited on my throne&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And she had only had that face and mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I with myself, had th' earth to her resigned.<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>On the anniversary of their wedding-day, he thus addresses her:&mdash;</p>


<h4>LOVE'S ANNIVERSARY.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Thou art returned (great light) to that blest hour<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In which I first by marriage, (sacred power!)<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Joined with Castara hearts; and as the same<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thy lustre is, as then,&mdash;so is our flame;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which had increased, but that by Love's decree,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'Twas such at first, it ne'er could greater be.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But tell me, (glorious lamp,) in thy survey<br /></span>

<span class="i2">By age to weakness? I since that have seen<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The rose bud forth and fade, the tree grow green,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And wither wrinkled. Even thyself dost yield<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Something to time, and to thy grave fall nigher;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">But virtuous love is one sweet endless fire.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"To Castara, on the knowledge of love," is peculiarly elegant; it was,
probably, suggested by some speculative topics of conversation,
discussed in the literary circle he had drawn round him at Hindlip.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

</div></div>

<p>It was owing to his affection for his wife, as well as his own retired
and studious habits, that Habington lived through the civil wars without
taking any active part on either side. It should seem that, at such a
period, no man of a lofty and generous spirit could have avoided joining
the party or principles, either of Falkland and Grandison, or of Hampden
and Hutchinson. But Habington's family had already suffered, in fortune
and in fame, by their interference with State matters; and without, in
any degree, implicating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span> himself with either party, he passed through
those stormy and eventful times,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i23">As one who dreams<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of idleness, in groves Elysian;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and died in the first year of the Protectorate, 1654. I cannot discover
the date of Castara's death; but she died some years before her husband,
leaving only one son.</p>

<p>There is one among the poems of the second part of Castara, which I
cannot pass without remark; it is the Elegy which Habington addressed to
his wife, on the death of her friend, Venetia Digby, the consort of the
famous Sir Kenelm Digby. She was the most beautiful woman of her time:
even Lord Clarendon steps aside from the gravity of history, to mention
"her extraordinary beauty, and as extraordinary fame." Her picture at
Windsor is, indeed, more like a vision of ideal loveliness, than any
form that ever trod the earth.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> She was descended<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> from the Percies
and the Stanleys, and was first cousin to Habington's Castara, their
mothers being sisters. The magnificent spirit of her enamoured husband,
surrounded her with the most gorgeous adornments that ever were invented
by vanity or luxury: and thus she was, one day, found dead on her couch,
her hand supporting her head, in the attitude of one asleep. Habington's
description exactly agrees with the picture at Althorpe, painted after
her death by Vandyke.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">What's honour but a hatchment? what is here<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of Percy left, or Stanley, names most dear<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To virtue?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or what avails her that she once was led<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A glorious bride to valiant Digby's bed?<br /></span>
<span class="i15">She, when whatever rare<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The either Indies boast, lay richly spread<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For her to wear, lay on her pillow <i>dead</i>!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is no piercing the mystery which hangs round the story of this
beautiful creature: that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> a stigma rested on her character, and that she
was exculpated from it, whatever it might be, seems proved, by the doves
and serpents introduced into several portraits of her; the first,
emblematical of her innocence, and the latter, of her triumph over
slander: and not less, by these lines of Habington. If Venetia Digby had
been, as Aubrey and others insinuate, abandoned to profligacy, and a
victim to her husband's jealousy, Habington would scarce have considered
her noble descent and relationship to his Castara as a matter of pride;
or her death as a subject of tender condolence; or the awful manner of
it a peculiar blessing of heaven, and the reward of her virtues.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Come likewise, my Castara, and behold<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What blessings ancient prophecy foretold,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Bestow'd on her in death; she past away<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So sweetly from the world as if her clay<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lay only down to slumber. Then forbear<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To let on her blest ashes fall a tear;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or if thou'rt too much woman, softly weep,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lest grief disturb the silence of her sleep!<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></div></div>

<p>The author of the introduction to the curious Memoirs of Sir Kenelm
Digby, has proved the absolute falsehood of some of Aubrey's assertions,
and infers the improbability of others. But these beautiful lines by
Habington, seem to have escaped his notice; and they are not slight
evidence in Venetia's favour. On the whole, the mystery remains
unexplained; a cloud has settled for ever on the true story of this
extraordinary creature. Neither the pen nor the sword of her husband
could entirely clear her fame in her own age: he could only terrify
slander into silence, and it died away into an indistinct murmur, of
which the echo alone has reached our time.&mdash;But this is enough:&mdash;the
echo of an <i>echo</i> could whisper into naught a woman's fair name. The
idea of a creature so formed in the prodigality of nature; so completely
and faultlessly beautiful; so nobly born and allied; so capable (as she
showed herself on various occasions,) of high generous feeling,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>

vices, or "done to death by slanderous tongues," is equally painful and
heart-sickening. The image of the asp trailing its slime and its venom
over the bosom of Cleopatra, is not more abhorrent.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>CONJUGAL POETRY CONTINUED.</h3>

<h3>THE TWO ZAPPI.</h3>


<p>We find among the minor poets of Italy, a charming, and I believe a
singular instance of a husband and a wife, both highly gifted, devoting
their talents to celebrate each other. These were Giambattista
Zappi,<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> the famous Roman advocate, and his wife Faustina, the
daughter of Carlo Maratti, the painter.</p>

<p>Zappi, after completing his legal studies at Bologna, came to reside at
Rome, where he distinguished himself in his profession, and was one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span> of
the founders of the academy of the Arcadii. Faustina Maratti was many
years younger than her husband, and extremely beautiful: she was her
father's favourite model for his Madonnas, Muses, and Vestal Virgins.
From a description of her, in an Epithalamium<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> on her marriage, it
appears that her eyes and hair were jet black, her features regular, and
her complexion pale and delicate; a style of beauty which, in its
perfection, is almost peculiar to Italy. To the mutual tenderness of
these married lovers, we owe some of the most elegant among the lighter
Italian lyrics. Zappi, in a Sonnet addressed to his wife some time after
their union, reminds her, with a tender exultation, of the moment they
first met; when she swept by him in all the pride of beauty, careless or
unconscious of his admiration,&mdash;and he bowed low before her, scarcely
daring to lift his eyes on the charms that were destined to bless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span> him;
"Who," he says, "would then have whispered me, the day will come when
you will smile to remember her disdain, for all this blaze of beauty was
created for you alone!" or would have said to her, "Know you who is
destined to touch that virgin heart? Even he, whom you now pass by
without even a look! Such are the miracles of love!"</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></div></div>

<p>The first Sonnet in Faustina's Canzoniere,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Dolce sollievo delle umane cure,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>is an eulogium on her husband, and describes her own confiding
tenderness. It is full of grace and sweetness, and feminine feeling:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Soave cortes&igrave;a, vezzosi accenti,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Virt&ugrave;, senno, valor d'alma gentile,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Or tu gli affetti miei puri innocenti<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Pasci cortese, e non cangiar tuo stile<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Dolce sollievo de' miei mali, amore!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Others are of a melancholy character; and one or two allude to the death
of an infant son, whom she tenderly laments. But the most finished of
all her poems is a Sonnet addressed to a lady whom her husband had
formerly loved;<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> the sentiment of which is truly beautiful and
feminine: never was jealousy so amiably, or so delicately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span> expressed.
There is something very dramatic and picturesque in the apostrophe which
Faustina addresses to her rival, and in the image of the lady "casting
down her large bright eyes:" as well as affecting in the abrupt recoil
of feeling in the last lines.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Neither Zappi nor his wife were authors by profession: her poems are
few; and all seem to flow from some incident or feeling, which awakened
her genius, and caused that "craving of the heart and the fancy to break
out into voluntary song, which men call inspiration." She became a
member of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span> the Arcadia, under the pastoral name of Aglaura Cidonia; and
it is remarkable, that though she survived her husband many years, I
cannot find any poem referring to her loss, nor of a subsequent date:
neither did she marry again, though in the prime of her life and beauty.</p>

<p>Zappi was a great and celebrated lawyer, and his legal skill raised him
to an office of trust, under the Pontificate of Clement XI. In one of
his Sonnets, which has great sweetness and picturesque effect, he
compares himself to the Venetian Gondolier, who in the calm or the storm
pours forth his songs on the Lagune, careless of blame or praise, asking
no auditors but the silent seas and the quiet moon, and seeking only to
"unburthen his full soul" in lays of love and joy&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Il Gondolier, sebben la notte imbruna,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Remo non posa, e fende il mar spumante;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lieto cantando a un bel raggio di Luna&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Intanto Erminia infra l'ombrose piante."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>That Zappi could be sublime, is proved by his well-known Sonnet on the
Moses of Michel Angelo; but his forte is the graceful and the gay.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> His
Anacreontics, and particularly his little drinking song,</p>

</div></div>

<p>are very elegant, and almost equal to Chiabrera. It is difficult to
sympathize with English drinking songs, and all the vulgar associations
of flowing bowls, taverns, three times three, and the table in a roar.
An Italian <i>Brindisi</i> transports us at once among flasks and vineyards,
guitars and dances, a dinner <i>al fresco</i>, a group <i>&agrave; la Stothard</i>. It is
all the difference between the ivy-crowned Bacchus, and the bloated
Silenus. "Bumper, Squire Jones," or, "Waiter, bring clean glasses," do
not <i>sound</i> so well as</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>CONJUGAL POETRY CONTINUED.</h3>

<h3>LORD LYTTELTON.</h3>


<p>Lord Lyttelton has told us in a very sweet line,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">How much the <i>wife</i> is dearer than the <i>bride</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But his Lucy Fortescue deserves more than a mere allusion, <i>en passant</i>.
That Lord Lyttelton is still remembered and read as a poet, is solely
for her sake: it is she who has made the shades of Hagley classic
ground, and hallowed its precincts by the remembrance of the fair and
gentle being, the tender woman, wife, and mother, who in the prime of
youth and loveliness, melted like a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> creature of air and light from her
husband's arms,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"And left him on this earth disconsolate!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>That the verses she inspired are still popular, is owing to the power of
<i>truth</i>, which has here given lasting interest to what were otherwise
<i>mediocre</i>. Lord Lyttelton was not much of a poet; but his love was
real; its object was real, beautiful, and good: thus buoyed up, in spite
of his own faults and the change of taste, he has survived the rest of
the rhyming gentry of his time, who wrote epigrams on fans and
shoe-buckles,&mdash;songs to the Duchess of <i>this</i> and the Countess of
<i>that</i>&mdash;and elegies to Miras, Delias, and Chloes.</p>

<p>Lucy Fortescue, daughter of Hugh Fortescue, Esq. of Devonshire, and
grand-daughter of Lord Aylmer, was born in 1718. She was about
two-and-twenty when Lord Lyttelton first became attached to her, and he
was in his thirty-first year: in person and character she realized all
he had imagined in his "Advice to Belinda."<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">....*....*....*....*<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Blest is the maid, and worthy to be blest,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whose soul, entire by him she loves possest,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Feels every vanity in fondness lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And asks no power, but that of pleasing most:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Her's is the bliss, in just return to prove<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The honest warmth of undissembled love;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For her, inconstant man might cease to range,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And gratitude forbid desire to change.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To the more peculiar attributes of her sex&mdash;beauty and tenderness,&mdash;she
united all the advantages of manner,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Polite as she in courts had ever been;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and wit&mdash;the only wit that becomes a woman,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">That temperately bright<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With inoffensive light<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All pleasing shone, nor ever past<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The decent bounds that wisdom's sober hand<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And sweet benevolence's mild command,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And bashful modesty before it cast.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Her education was uncommon for the time; for <i>then</i>, a woman, who to
youth and elegance and beauty united a familiar acquaintance with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
literature of her own country, French, Italian, and the classics, was
distinguished among her sex. She had many suitors, and her choice was
equally to her own honour and that of her lover. Lord Lyttelton was not
rich; his father, Sir Thomas Lyttelton, being still alive. He had
perhaps never dreamed of the coronet which late in life descended on his
brow: and far from possessing a captivating exterior, he was extremely
plain in person, "of a feeble, ill-compacted figure, and a meagre sallow
countenance."<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> But talents, elegance of mind, and devoted affection,
had the influence they ought to have, and generally do possess, in the
mind of a woman. We are told that our sex's "earliest, latest care,&mdash;our
heart's supreme ambition," is "to be fair." Even Madame de Stael would
have given half her talents for half Madame Recamier's beauty! and why?
because the passion of our sex is to please and to be loved; and men
have taught us, that in nine cases out of ten we are valued merely for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
our personal advantages: they can scarce believe that women, generally
speaking, are so indifferent to the mere exterior of a man,&mdash;that it has
so little power to interest their vanity or affections. Let there be
something for their hearts to honour, and their weakness to repose on,
and feeling and imagination supply the rest. In this respect, the
"gentle lady married to the Moor," who saw her lover's visage in his
mind, is the type of our sex;&mdash;the instances are without number. The
Frenchman triumphs a little too much <i>en petit maitre</i>, who sings,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Grands Dieux, combien elle est jolie!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Et moi, je suis, je suis si laid!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He might have spared his exultation: if he had sense, and spirit, and
tenderness, he had all that is necessary to please a woman, who is
worthy to be pleased.</p>

<p>Personal vanity in a woman, however misdirected, arises from the idea,
that our power with those we wish to charm, is founded on beauty as a
female attribute; it is never indulged but with a reference to
another&mdash;it is a <i>means</i>, not an <i>end</i>. Personal vanity in a man is
sheer unmingled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> egotism, and an unfailing subject of ridicule and
contempt with all women&mdash;be they wise or foolish.</p>

<p>To return from this long <i>tirade</i> to Lucy Fortescue.&mdash;After the usual
fears and hopes, the impatience and anxious suspense of a long
courtship,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Lord Lyttelton won his Lucy, and thought himself
blest&mdash;and was so. Five revolving years of happiness seemed pledges of
its continuance, and "the wheels of pleasure moved without the aid of
hope:"&mdash;it was at the conclusion of the fifth year, he wrote the lines
on the anniversary of his marriage, in which he exults in his felicity,
and in the possession of a treasure, which even then, though he knew it
not, was fading in his arms.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Whence then this strange increase of joy?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He, only he can tell, who matched like me,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">How much the <i>wife</i> is dearer than the <i>bride</i>!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Six months afterwards, his Lucy was seized with the illness of which she
died in her twenty-ninth year, leaving three infants, the eldest not
four years old.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> As there are people who strangely unite, as
inseparable, the ideas of fiction and rhyme, and doubt the sincerity of
her husband's grief, because he wrote a monody on her memory, he shall
speak for himself in prose. The following is an extract from his letter
to his father, written two days before her death.</p>

<p>"I believe God supports me above my own strength, for the sake of my
friends who are concerned for me, and in return for the resignation with
which I endeavour to submit to his will. If<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span> it please Him, in his
infinite mercy, to restore my dear wife to me, I shall most thankfully
acknowledge his goodness; if not, I shall most humbly endure his
chastisement, which I have too much deserved. These are the sentiments
with which my mind is replete; but as it is still a most bitter cup, how
my body will bear it, if it must not pass from me, it is impossible for
me to foretell; but I hope the best.&mdash;Jan. 17th, 1747."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I imagine Dr. Johnson meant a sneer at Lord Lyttelton, when he says
laconically,&mdash;"his wife died, and he <i>solaced</i> himself by writing a long
monody on her memory."&mdash;In these days we might naturally exclaim against
a widowed husband who should <i>solace</i> himself by apostrophes to the
Muses and Graces, and bring in the whole Aonian choir,&mdash;Pindus and
Castalia, Aganippe's fount, and Thespian vales; the Clitumnus and the
Illissus, and such Pagan and classical embroidery.&mdash;What should we have
thought of Lord Byron's famous "Fare thee well," if conceived in this
style?&mdash;but such was the poetical vocabulary of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span> Lord Lyttelton's day:
and that he had not sufficient genius and originality to rise above it,
is no argument against the sincerity of his grief. Petrarch and his
Laura (<i>apropos</i> to all that has ever been sung or said of love for five
hundred years) are called, in a very common-place strain, from their
"Elysian bowers;" and then follow some lines of real and touching
beauty, because they owe nothing to art or effort, but are the immediate
result of truth and feeling. He is still apostrophising Petrarch.</p>

<p>One would wish to think that Lord Lyttelton was faithful to the memory
of his Lucy: but he was neither more nor less than man; and in the
impatience of grief, or unable to live without that domestic happiness
to which his charming wife had accustomed him, he married again, about
two years after her death, and too precipitately. His second choice was
Elizabeth Rich, eldest daughter of Sir Robert Rich. Perhaps he expected
too much; and how few women could have replaced Lucy Fortescue! The
experiment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span> proved a most unfortunate one, and added bitterness to his
regrets. He devoted the rest of his life to politics and literature.</p>

<p>About ten years after his second marriage, Lord Lyttelton made a tour
into Wales with a gay party. On some occasion, while they stood
contemplating a scene of uncommon picturesque beauty, he turned to a
friend, and asked him, with enthusiasm, whether it was possible to
behold a more pleasing sight? Yes, answered the other&mdash;the countenance
of the woman one loves! Lord Lyttelton shrunk, as if probed to the
quick; and after a moment's silence, replied pensively&mdash;"<i>once</i>, I
thought so!"<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>Lord Lyttelton brings to mind his friend and patron, Frederick Prince of
Wales (grandfather of the present King). From the impression which
<i>history</i> has given of his character, no one, I believe, would suspect
him of being a poet, though he was known as the patron of poets. He
sometimes amused himself with writing French and English songs, &amp;c. in
imitation of the Regent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span> Duc d'Orleans. But, assuredly, it was not in
imitation of the Regent he chose his own wife for the principal subject
of his ditties. In the same manner, and in the same worthy spirit of
imitation of the same worthy person, he tried hard to be a libertine,
and laid siege to the virtue of sundry maids of honour; preferring all
the time, in his inmost soul, his own wife to the handsomest among her
attendants. His flirtations with Lady Archibald Hamilton and Miss Vane
had not half the grace or sincerity of some of his effusions to the
Princess, whom he tenderly loved, and used to call, with a sort of
pastoral gallantry, "ma Sylvie." One of his songs has been preserved by
that delicious retailer of court-gossip, Horace Walpole; and I copy it
from the Appendix to his Memoirs, without agreeing in his flippant
censure.</p>

<p>This amiable and beloved wife died after a union of five or six years,
and left her husband broken-hearted. Her sweetness and loveliness, and
the general sympathy caused by her death, drew a touch of deep feeling
from the pen of Swift, who mentions the event in his journal to Stella:
every one, he says, grieved for her husband, "they were so happy
together." Poor Parnell did not, in his bereavement, try Lord
Lyttelton's specifics: he did not write an elegy, nor a monody, nor did
he marry again;&mdash;and, unfortunately for himself, he could not subdue his
mind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span> to religious resignation. His grief and his nervous irritability
proved too much for his reason: he felt what all have felt under the
influence of piercing anguish,&mdash;a dread, a horror of being left alone:
he flew to society; when that was not at hand, he sought relief from
excesses which his constitution would not bear, and died, unhappy man!
in the prime of life; "a martyr," as Goldsmith tells us, "to conjugal
fidelity."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>CONJUGAL POETRY CONTINUED.</h3>

<h3>KLOPSTOCK AND META.</h3>


<p>Then is there not the German Klopstock and his Meta,&mdash;his lovely,
devoted, angelic Meta? As the subject of some of her husband's most
delightful and popular poems, both before and after her marriage,&mdash;when
living, she formed his happiness on earth; and when, as he tenderly
imagined, she watched over his happiness from heaven&mdash;how pass her
lightly over in a work like this? Yet how do her justice, but by
borrowing her own sweet words? or referring the reader at once to the
memoirs and fragments of her letters, which never saw the light till
sixty years after her death?&mdash;for in her there was no vain-glory, no
effort, no display. A feeling so hallowed lingers round the memory of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
this angelic creature, that it is rather a subject to blend with our
most sacred and most serious thoughts,&mdash;to muse over in hours when the
heart communes with itself and is still, than to dress out in words, and
mingle with the ideas of earthly fame and happiness. Other loves might
be poetical, but the love of Klopstock and his Meta was in itself
<i>poetry</i>. They were mutually possessed with the idea, that they had been
predestined to each other from the beginning of time, and that their
meeting on earth was merely a kind of incidental prelude to an eternal
and indivisible union in heaven: and shall we blame their fond faith?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">It is a gentle and affectionate thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That in immeasurable heights above us,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Even at our birth, the wreath of love was woven<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With sparkling stars for flowers!<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>All the sweetest images that ever were grouped together by fancy,
dreaming over the golden age; beauty, innocence, and happiness; the
fervour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span> of youthful love, the rapture of corresponding affection;
undoubting faith and undissembled truth;&mdash;these were so bound together,
so exalted by the highest and holiest associations, so confirmed in the
serenity of conscious virtue, so sanctified by religious enthusiasm; and
in the midst of all human blessedness, so wrapt up in futurity,&mdash;that
the grave was not the close, but the completion and the consummation of
their happiness. The garland which poesy has suspended on the grave of
Meta, was wreathed by no fabled muse; it is not of laurel, "meed of
conqueror and sage;" nor of roses blooming and withering among their
thorns; nor of myrtle shrinking and dying away before the blast: but of
flowers gathered in Paradise, pure and bright, and breathing of their
native Eden; which never caught one blighting stain of earth, and though
dewed with tears,&mdash;"tears such as angels shed!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The name of Klopstock forms an epoch in the history of poetry. Go&euml;the,
Schiller, Wieland, have since adorned German literature; but Klopstock<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
was the first to impress on the poetry of his country the stamp of
nationality. He was a man of great and original genius,&mdash;gifted with an
extraordinary degree of sensibility and imagination; but these being
united to the most enthusiastic religious feeling, elevated and never
misled him. His life was devoted to the three noblest sentiments that
can fill and animate the human soul,&mdash;religion, patriotism and love. To
these, from early youth, he devoted his faculties and consecrated his
talents. He had, even in his boyhood, resolved to write a poem, "which
should do honour to God, his country, and himself;" and he produced the
Messiah. It would be difficult to describe the enthusiasm this work
excited when the first three cantos appeared in 1746. "If poetry had its
saints," says Madame de Stael, "then Klopstock would be at the head of
the calendar;" and she adds, with a burst of her own eloquence, "Ah,
qu'il est beau le talent, quand on ne l'a jamais profan&eacute;! quand il n'a
servi qu'a rev&egrave;ler aux hommes, sous la forme attrayante des beaux arts,
les sentiments g&eacute;ner&eacute;ux, et les esperances<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> r&eacute;ligieuses obscurcies au
fond de leur c&oelig;ur!"</p>

<p>Such was Klopstock as a poet. As a man, he is described as one of the
most amiable and affectionate of human beings;&mdash;"good in all the
foldings of his heart," as his sweet wife expressed it; free from all
petty vanity, egotism, and worldly ambition. He was pleasing, though not
handsome in person, with fine blue animated eyes.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> The tone of his
voice was at first low and hesitating, but soft and persuasive; and he
always ended by captivating the entire attention of those he addressed.
He was, to his latest moments, fond of the society of women, and an
object of their peculiar tenderness and veneration.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>
<p>Klopstock's first serious attachment was to his cousin, the beautiful
Fanny Schmidt, the sister of his intimate friend and brother poet,
Schmidt. He loved her constantly for several years. His correspondence
with Bodmer gives us an interesting picture of a fine mind struggling
with native timidity, and of the absolute terror with which this gentle
and beautiful girl could inspire him, till his heart seemed to wither
and sicken within him from her supposed indifference. The uncertainty of
his future prospects, and his sublime idea of the merits and beauties of
her he loved, kept him silent; nor did he ever venture to declare his
passion, except in the beautiful odes and songs which she inspired.
Speaking of one of those to his friend Bodmer, he says, "She who could
best reward it, has not seen it; so timid does her apparent
insensibility make me."</p>

<p>Whether this insensibility was more than apparent is not perfectly
clear: the memoirs of Klopstock are not quite accurate or satisfactory
in this part of his history. It should seem from the published
correspondence, that his love was distinctly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span> avowed, though he never
had courage to make a direct offer of himself. Fanny Schmidt appears to
have been a superior woman in point of mind, and full of admiration for
his genius. She writes to him in terms of friendship and kindness, but
she leaves him, after three years' attachment on his part, still in
doubt whether her heart remain untouched,&mdash;and even whether she <i>had</i> a
heart to be touched. He intimates, but with a tender and guarded
delicacy, that he had reason to complain of her coquetry;<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> and, with
the sensibility of a proud but wounded heart, he was anxious to prove to
himself that his romantic tenderness had not been unworthily bestowed.
"All the peace and consolation of my after life depends on knowing
whether Fanny <i>really</i> has a heart?&mdash;a heart that <i>could</i> have
sympathised with mine?"<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> He had commissioned his friend Gleim to
plead his cause, to sound her heart in its inmost depths; and in return,
received the intelligence of her approaching union with another. "When
(as he expresses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span> it) not a hope was left to be destroyed," he became
calm; but he suffered at first acutely; and this ill-fated attachment
tinged with a deep gloom nearly four years of his life. While in
suspense, he continually repeats his conviction that he can never love
again. "Had I never seen her, I might have attached myself to another
object, and perhaps have known the felicity of mutual love! But now it
is impossible; my heart is steeled to every tender impression." The
sentiment was natural; but, fortunately for himself, he was deceived.</p>

<p>In passing through Hamburgh, in April 1751, and while he was still under
the influence of this heart-wearing attachment to Fanny, he was
introduced to Meta M&ouml;ller. The impression she made on him is thus
described, in a letter to his friend and confidant, Gleim.</p>

<p>"You may perhaps have heard Gisecke mention Margaret M&ouml;ller of Hamburgh.
I was lately introduced to this girl, and passed in her society most of
the time I lately spent at Hamburgh. I found her, in every sense of the
word,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> so lovely, so amiable, so full of attractions, that I could at
times scarcely forbear to give her the name which is to me the dearest
in existence. I was often with her alone; and in those moments of
unreserved intercourse, was insensibly led to communicate my melancholy
story. Could you have seen her in those moments, my Gleim! how she
looked and listened,&mdash;and how often she interrupted me, and how tenderly
she wept! and if you knew how much she is my friend; and yet it was not
for <i>her</i> that I had so long suffered. What a heart must she possess to
be thus touched for a stranger! At this thought I am almost tempted to
make a comparison; but then does a mist gather before mine eyes, and if
I probe my heart, I feel that I am more unhappy than ever." Again he
writes from Copenhagen, "I have reread the little M&ouml;ller's letters;
sweet artless creature she is! She has already written to me four times,
and writes in a style so exquisitely natural! Were you to see this
lovely girl, and read her letters, you would scarce conceive it possible
that she should be mistress of the French, English,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span> and Italian
languages, and even conversant with Greek and Italian literature." But
it were wronging both, to give the history and result of this attachment
to Meta in any language but her own. Since the publication of
Richardson's correspondence, the letters addressed to him, in English,
by Meta Klopstock, have become generally known; but this account would
be incomplete were they wholly omitted; and those who have read them
before, will not be displeased at the opportunity of re-perusing them:
her sweet lisping English is worth volumes of eloquence.</p>

<p>"You will know all what concerns me. Love, dear Sir, is all what me
concerns, and love shall be all what I will tell you in this letter. In
one happy night I read my husband's poem&mdash;the Messiah. I was extremely
touched with it. The next day I asked one of his friends who was the
author of this poem? and this was the first time I heard Klopstock's
name. I believe I fell immediately in love with him; at the least, my
thoughts were ever with him filled, especially because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> his friend told
me very much of his character. But I had no hopes ever to see him, when
quite unexpectedly I heard that he should pass through Hamburgh. I wrote
immediately to the same friend, for procuring by his means that I might
see the author of the Messiah, when in Hamburg. He told him that a
certain girl in Hamburg wished to see him, and, for all recommendation,
showed him some letters in which I made bold to criticize Klopstock's
verses. Klopstock came, and came to me. I must confess, that, though
greatly prepossessed of his qualities, I never thought him the amiable
youth that I found him. This made its effect. After having seen him two
hours, I was obliged to pass the evening in company, which never had
been so wearisome to me. I could not speak; I could not play; I thought
I saw nothing but Klopstock. I saw him the next day, and the following,
and we were very seriously friends; on the fourth day he departed. It
was a strong hour, the hour of his departure. He wrote soon after, and
from that time our correspondence began to be a very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span> diligent one. I
sincerely believed my love to be friendship. I spoke with my friends of
nothing but Klopstock, and showed his letters. They rallied me, and said
I was in love. I rallied them again, and said they must have a very
friendship-less heart, if they had no idea of friendship to a man as
well as a woman. Thus it continued eight months, in which time my
friends found as much love in Klopstock's letters as in me. I perceived
it likewise, but I would not believe it. At the last, Klopstock said
plainly that he loved; and I startled as for a wrong thing. I answered
that it was no love, but friendship, as it was what I felt for him; we
had not seen one another enough to love; as if love must have more time
than friendship! This was sincerely my meaning; and I had this meaning
till Klopstock came again to Hamburg. This he did a year after we had
seen one another the first time. We saw, we were friends; we loved, and
we believed that we loved; and a short time after I could even tell
Klopstock that I loved. But we were obliged to part again, and wait two
years for our wedding.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span> My mother would not let me marry a stranger. I
could marry without her consentment, as by the death of my father my
fortune depended not on her; but this was an horrible idea for me; and
thank Heaven that I have prevailed by prayers! At this time, knowing
Klopstock, she loves him as her son, and thanks God that she has not
persisted. We married, and I am the happiest wife in the world. In some
few months it will be four years that I am so happy; and still I dote
upon Klopstock as if he was my bridegroom. If you knew my husband, you
would not wonder. If you knew his poem, I could describe him very
briefly, in saying he is in all respects what he is as a poet. This I
can say with all wifely modesty; I am all raptures when I do it. And as
happy as I am in love, so happy am I in friendship;&mdash;in my mother, two
elder sisters, and five other women. How rich I am! Sir, you have willed
that I should speak of myself, but I fear that I have done it too much.
Yet you see how it interests me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>I have somewhere seen or heard it observed, that there is nothing in the
Romeo and Juliet more finely imagined or more true to nature than
Romeo's previous love for another. It is while writhing under the
coldness and scorn of his proud, inaccessible Rosaline, she who had
"forsworn to love," that he meets the soft glances of Juliet, whose eyes
"do comfort, and not burn;" and he takes refuge in her bosom, for she</p>

<p>With such a grateful and gratified feeling must Klopstock have gathered
to his arms the devoted Meta, who came, with healing on her lips, to
suck forth the venom of a recent wound. He has himself beautifully
expressed this in one of the poems addressed to her, and which he has
entitled the Recantation. He describes the anguish he had suffered from
an unrequited affection, and the day-spring of renovated hope and
rapture which now dawned in his heart.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>This little poem has been translated by Elizabeth Smith, with one or two
of the graceful little songs addressed to Meta, under the name of
<i>Cidli</i>. This is the appellation given to Jairus' daughter in the
"Messiah;" and Meta, who was fond of the character, probably chose it
for herself. The first cantos of this poem had been published long
before his marriage, and it was continued after his union with Meta, and
at her side. Nothing can be more charming than the picture of domestic
affection and happiness contained in the following passage of one of her
letters to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span> Richardson:&mdash;apparently, she had improved in English, since
the last was written.&mdash;"It will be a delightful occupation for me to
make you more acquainted with my husband's poem. Nobody can do it better
than I, being the person who knows the most of that which is not
published; being always present at the birth of the young verses, which
begin by fragments here and there, of a subject of which his soul is
just then filled. He has many great fragments of the whole work ready.
You may think that persons who love as we do, have no need of two
chambers; we are always in the same: I, with my little
work,&mdash;still&mdash;still&mdash;only regarding sometimes my husband's sweet face,
which is so venerable at that time, with tears of devotion, and all the
sublimity of the subject. My husband reading me his young verses, and
suffering my criticisms."</p>

<p>And for the task of criticism, Meta was peculiarly fitted, not less by
her fine cultivated mind and feminine delicacy of taste, than by her
affectionate enthusiasm for her husband's glory.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span> "How much," says
Klopstock, writing after her death, "how much do I lose in her even in
this respect! How perfect was her taste, how exquisitely fine her
feelings! she observed every thing, even to the slightest turn of the
thought. I had only to look at her, and could see in her face when a
syllable pleased or displeased her: and when I led her to explain the
reason of her remarks, no demonstration could be more true, more
accurate, or more appropriate to the subject. But in general this gave
us very little trouble, for we understood each other when we had
scarcely begun to explain our ideas."</p>

<p>And that not a stain of the selfish or earthly should rest on the bright
purity of her mind and heart, it must be remarked that we cannot trace
in all her letters, whether before or after marriage, the slightest
feeling of jealousy or doubt, though the woman lived whom Klopstock had
once exalted into a divinity, and though she loved her husband with the
most impassioned enthusiasm. She expresses frankly her admiration of the
odes and songs addressed to Fanny:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span> and her only sentiment seems to be a
mixture of grief and astonishment, that any woman could be so insensible
as not to love Klopstock, or so cruel as to give him pain.</p>

<p>Though in her letters to Richardson she speaks with rapture of her hopes
of becoming a mother, as all that was wanting to complete her
happiness,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> she had long prepared herself for a fatal termination to
those hopes. Her constant presentiment of approaching death, she
concealed, in tenderness to her husband. When we consider the fond and
entire confidence which existed between them, this must have cost no
small effort of fortitude: "she was formed," said Klopstock,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span> "to say,
like Arria, 'My P&aelig;tus,' 'tis not painful:" but her husband pressed her
not to allow any secret feeling to prey on her mind; and then, with
gratitude for his "permission to speak," she avowed her apprehensions,
and at the same time her strong and animated trust in religion. This
whole letter, to which I must refer the reader, (for any attempt I
should make to copy it entire, would certainly be illegible,) is one of
the most beautiful pieces of tender eloquence that ever fell from a
woman's pen: and that is saying much. She is writing to her husband
during a short absence. "I well know," she says, "that all hours are not
alike, and particularly the last, since death, in my situation, must be
far from an easy death; but let the last hour make no impression on you.
You know too well how much the body then presses down the soul. Let God
give what he will, I shall still be happy. A longer life with you, or
eternal life with Him! But can you as easily part from me as I from you?
You are to remain in this world, in a world without <i>me</i>! You know I
have always wished to be the survivor,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span> because I well know it is the
hardest to endure; but perhaps it is the will of God that you should be
left; and perhaps you have most strength."</p>

<p>This last letter is dated September 10th, 1754. Her confinement took
place in November following; and after the most cruel and protracted
sufferings, it became too certain that both must perish,&mdash;mother and
child.</p>

<p>Klopstock stood beside her, and endeavoured, as well as the agony of his
feelings would permit, to pray with her and to support her. He praised
her fortitude:&mdash;"You have endured like an angel! God has been with you!
he <i>will</i> be with you! were I so wretched as not to be a Christian, I
should now become one." He added with strong emotion, "Be my guardian
angel, if God permit!" She replied tenderly, "You have ever been mine!"
He repeated his request more fervently: she answered with a look of
undying love, "Who would not be so!" He hastened from the room, unable
to endure more. After he was gone, her sister,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> who attended her
through her sufferings,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span> said to her, "God will help you!"&mdash;"Yes, to
heaven!" replied the saint. After a faint struggle, she added, "It is
over!" her head sunk on the pillow, and while her eyes, until glazed by
death, were fixed tenderly on her sister,&mdash;thus with the faith of a
Christian, and the courage of a martyr, she resigned into the hands of
her Creator, a life which had been so blameless and so blessed, so
intimate with love and joy, that only such a death could crown it, by
proving what an angel a woman <i>can</i> be, in doing, feeling, and
suffering.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It was by many expected that Klopstock would have made the loss of his
Meta the subject of a poem; but he early declared his resolution not to
do this, nor to add to the collection of odes and songs formerly
addressed to her. He gives his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span> reasons for this silence. "I think that
before the public a man should speak of his wife with the same modesty
as of himself; and this principle would destroy the enthusiasm required
in poetry. The reader too, not without reason, would feel himself
justified in refusing implicit credit to the fond eulogium written on
one beloved; and my love for her who made me the happiest among men, is
too sincere to let me allow my readers to call it in question." Yet in a
little poem<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> addressed afterwards to his friend Schmidt, and probably
not intended for publication, he alludes to his loss, in a tone of deep
feeling, and complains of the recollections which distract his sleepless
nights.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Again the form of my lost wife I see,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She lies before me, and she dies again;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Again she smiles on me, again she dies,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Her eyes now close, and comfort me no more.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></div></div>

<p>He indulged the fond thought that she hovered, a guardian spirit, near
him still,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">O if thou love me yet, by heavenly laws<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Condemn me not! I am a man and mourn,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Support me though unseen!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And he foretells that, even in distant ages,&mdash;"in times perhaps more
virtuous than ours," his grief would be remembered, and the name of his
Meta revered. And shall it not be so?&mdash;it must&mdash;it will:&mdash;as long as
truth, virtue, tenderness, dwell in woman's breast&mdash;so long shall Meta
be dear to her sex; for she has honoured us among men on earth, and
among saints in Heaven!</p>

<p>And now, how shall I fill up this sketch? Let us pause for a moment, and
suppose the fate of Meta and Klopstock reversed, and that <i>she</i> had been
called, according to her own tender and unselfish wish, to be the
survivor. Under such a terrible dispensation, her angelic meekness and
sublime faith would at first have supported her; she would have rejoiced
in the <i>certainty</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span> of her husband's blessedness, and in the yearning of
her heart she would have tried to fancy him ever present with her in
spirit; she would have collected together his works, and have occupied
herself in transmitting his glory as a poet, without a blemish, to the
admiration of posterity; she would have gone about all her feminine
duties with a quiet patience&mdash;for it would have been <i>his</i> will; and
would have smiled&mdash;and her smile would have been like the moonlight on a
winter lake: and with all her thoughts loosened from the earth, to her
there would never more have been good or evil, or grief, or fear, or
joy: space and time would only have existed to her, as they separated
her from <i>him</i>. Thus she would have lived on dyingly from day to day,
and then have perished, less through regret, than through the intense
longing to realize the vision of her heart, and rejoin him, without whom
all concerns of life were vain, and less than nothing. And this, I am
well convinced,&mdash;as far as one human being may dare to reason on the
probable result of certain feelings and impulses in another,&mdash;would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
have been the lot of Meta, if left on the earth alone, and desolate.</p>

<p>If Klopstock acted differently, let him not be too severely arraigned;
he was but a man, and differently constituted. With great sensibility,
he possessed, by nature, an elasticity of spirit which could rebound, as
it were, from the very depths of grief: his sorrow, intense at first,
found many outward resources:&mdash;he could speak, he could write; his
vivacity of imagination pictured to him Meta happy; and his habitual
religious feeling made him acquiesce in his own privation; he could
please himself with visiting her grave, and every year he planted it
with white lilies, "because the lily was the most exalted among flowers,
and she was the most exalted among women."<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> He had many friends, to
whom the confiding simplicity of his character had endeared him: all his
life he seems to have clung to friendship as a child clings to the
breast of the mother; he was accustomed to seek and find relief in
sympathy; and sympathy, deeply<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span> felt and strongly expressed, was all
around him. With his high intellect and profound feeling, there was ever
a child-like buoyancy in the mind of Klopstock, which gained him the
title of <i>der ewigen jungling</i>&mdash;"The ever young, or the youth for
ever."<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> His mind never fell into "the sear and yellow leaf," it was a
perpetual spring: the flowers grew and withered, and blossomed again,&mdash;a
never-failing succession of fragrance and beauty; when the rose wounded
him, he gathered the lily; when the lily died on his bosom, he cherished
the myrtle. And he was most happy in such a character, for in him it was
allied to the highest virtue and genius, and equally remote from
weakness and selfishness.</p>

<p>About four years after the death of Meta, he became extremely attached
to a young girl of Blackenburg, whose name was Dona; she loved and
admired him in return, but naturally felt some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span> distrust in the warmth
of his attachment; and he addressed to her a little poem, in which,
tenderly alluding to Meta, he assures Dona that <i>she</i> is not less dear
to him or <i>less</i> necessary to his happiness<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And such is <i>man's</i> fidelity!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This intended marriage never took place.</p>

<p>Twenty-five years afterwards, when Klopstock was in his sixtieth year,
he married Johanna von Wentham, a near relation of his Meta; an
excellent and amiable woman, whose affectionate attention cheered the
remaining years of his life.</p>

<p>Klopstock died at Hamburg in 1813, at the age of eighty: his remains
were attended to the grave by all the magistrates, the diplomatic corps,
the clergy, foreign generals, and a concourse of about fifty thousand
persons. His sacred poems were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span> placed on his coffin, and in the
intervals of the chanting, the ministering clergyman took up the book,
and read aloud the fine passage in the Messiah, describing the death of
the righteous.&mdash;Happy are they who have so consecrated their genius to
the honour of Him who bestowed it, that the productions of their early
youth may be placed without profanation on their tomb!</p>

<p>He was buried under a lime-tree in the churchyard of Ottensen, by the
side of his Meta and her infant,&mdash;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>CONJUGAL POETRY CONTINUED.</h3>

<h3>BONNIE JEAN.</h3>


<p>It was as Burns's <i>wife</i> as well as his early love, that Bonnie Jean
lives immortalized in her poet's songs, and that her name is destined to
float in music from pole to pole. When they first met, Burns was about
six-and-twenty, and Jean Armour "but a young thing,"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Wi' tempting lips and roguish e'en,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>the pride, the beauty, and the favourite toast of the village of
Mauchline, where her father lived. To an early period of their
attachment, or to the fond recollection of it in after times, we owe
some of Burns's most beautiful and impassioned songs,&mdash;as</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Come, let me take thee to this breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And pledge we ne'er shall sunder!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And I'll spurn as vilest dust,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The world's wealth and grandeur, &amp;c.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></div></div>

<p>"O poortith cold and restless love;" "the kind love that's in her e'e;"
"Lewis, what reck I by thee;" and many others. I conjecture, from a
passage in one of Burns's letters, that Bonnie Jean also furnished the
heroine and the subject of that admirable song, "O whistle, and I'll
come to thee, my lad," so full of buoyant spirits and artless affection:
it appears that she wished to have her name introduced into it, and that
he afterwards altered the fourth line of the first verse to please
her:&mdash;thus,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Thy Jeanie will venture wi' ye, my lad;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>but this amendment has been rejected by singers and editors, as injuring
the musical accentuation: the anecdote, however, and the introduction of
the name, give an additional interest and a truth to the sentiment, for
which I could be content to sacrifice the beauty of a single line; and

regard to her personal attractions, Jean was at this time a blooming
girl, animated with health, affection, and gaiety: the perfect symmetry
of her slender figure; her light step in the dance; the "waist sae
jimp," "the foot sae sma'," were no fancied beauties:&mdash;she had a
delightful voice, and sung with much taste and enthusiasm the ballads of
her native country; among which we may imagine that the songs of her
lover were not forgotten. The consequences, however, of all this
dancing, singing, and loving, were not quite so poetical as they were
embarrassing.</p>

<p>Burns had long been distinguished in his rustic neighbourhood for his
talents, for his social qualities and his conquests among the maidens of
his own rank. His personal appearance is thus described from memory by
Sir Walter Scott:&mdash;"His form was strong and robust, his manner rustic,
not clownish; with a sort of dignified simplicity, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span> received part
of its effect, perhaps, from one's knowledge of his extraordinary
talents; * * * his eye alone, I think, indicated the poetical character
and temperament; it was large, and of a dark cast, which glowed, (I say,
literally, <i>glowed</i>) when he spoke with feeling and interest;"&mdash;"his
address to females was extremely deferential, and always with a turn
either to the pathetic or humorous, which engaged their attention
particularly. I have heard the late Duchess of Gordon remark
this;"<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>&mdash;and Allan Cunningham, speaking also from recollection, says,
"he had a very manly countenance, and a very dark complexion; his
habitual expression was intensely melancholy, but at the presence of
those he loved or esteemed, his whole face beamed with affection and
genius;"<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>&mdash;"his voice was very musical; and he excelled in dancing,
and all athletic sports which required strength and agility."</p>

<p>Is it surprising that powers of fascination, which carried a Duchess
"off her feet," should conquer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span> the heart of a country lass of low
degree? Bonnie Jean was too soft-hearted, or her lover too irresistible;
and though Burns stepped forward to repair their transgression by a
written acknowledgment of marriage, which, in Scotland, is sufficient to
constitute a legal union, still his circumstances, and his character as
a "wild lad," were such, that nothing could appease her father's
indignation; and poor Jean, when humbled and weakened by the
consequences of her fault and her sense of shame, was prevailed on to
destroy the document of her lover's fidelity to his vows, and to reject
him.</p>

<p>Burns was nearly heart-broken by this dereliction, and between grief and
rage was driven to the verge of insanity. His first thought was to fly
the country; the only alternative which presented itself, "was America
or a jail;" and such were the circumstances under which he wrote his
"Lament," which, though not composed in his native dialect, is poured
forth with all that energy and pathos which only truth could impart.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

</div></div>

<p>This was about 1786: two years afterwards, when the publication of his
poems had given him name and fame, Burns revisited the scenes which his
Jeanie had endeared to him: thus he sings exultingly,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">I'll aye ca' in by yon town,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And by yon garden-green, again;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">And see my bonnie Jean again!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>They met in secret; a reconciliation took place; and the consequences
were, that bonnie Jean, being again exposed to the indignation of her
family, was literally turned out of her father's house. When the news
reached Burns he was lying ill; he was lame from the consequences of an
accident,&mdash;the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span> moment he could stir, he flew to her, went through the
ceremony of marriage with her in presence of competent witnesses, and a
few months afterwards he brought her to his new farm at Elliesland, and
established her under his roof as his wife, and the honoured mother of
his children.</p>

<p>It was during this <i>second-hand</i> honeymoon, happier and more endeared
than many have proved in their first gloss, that Burns wrote several of
the sweetest effusions ever inspired by his Jean; even in the days of
their early wooing, and when their intercourse had all the difficulty,
all the romance, all the mystery, a poetical lover could desire. Thus
practically controverting his own opinion, "that conjugal love does not
make such a figure in poesy as that other love," &amp;c.&mdash;for instance, we
have that most beautiful song, composed when he left his Jean at Ayr (in
the <i>west</i> of Scotland,) and had gone to prepare for her at Elliesland,
near Dumfries.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>In November 1788, Mrs. Burns took up her residence at Elliesland, and
entered on her duties as a wife and mistress of a family, and her
husband welcomed her to her home ("her ain roof-tree,") with the lively,
energetic, but rather unquotable song, "I hae a wife o' my ain;" and
subsequently he wrote for her, "O were I on Parnassus Hill," and that
delightful little bit of simple feeling&mdash;</p>

<p>and one of the finest of all his ballads, "Their groves o' green
myrtle," which not only presents a most exquisite rural picture to the
fancy, but breathes the very soul of chastened and conjugal tenderness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>I remember, as a particular instance&mdash;I suppose there are thousands&mdash;of
the tenacity with which Burns seizes on the memory, and twines round the
very fibres of one's heart, that when I was travelling in Italy, along
that beautiful declivity above the river Clitumnus, languidly enjoying
the balmy air, and gazing with no careless eye on those scenes of rich
and classical beauty, over which memory and fancy had shed</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">A light, a glory, a fair luminous cloud<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Enveloping the earth;<br /></span>

<p>even then, by some strange association, a feeling of my childish years
came over me, and all the livelong day I was singing, <i>sotto voce</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Their groves o' sweet myrtle let foreign lands reckon,<br /></span>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Thus the heath, and the blue-bell, and the gowan, had superseded the
orange and the myrtle on those Elysian plains,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Where the crush'd weed sends forth a rich perfume.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And Burns and Bonnie Jean were in my heart and on my lips, on the spot
where Virgil had sung, and Fabius and Hannibal met.</p>

<p>Besides celebrating her in verse, Burns has left us a description of his
Bonnie Jean in prose. He writes (some months after his marriage) to his
friend Miss Chalmers,&mdash;"If I have not got polite tattle, modish manners,
and fashionable dress, I am not sickened and disgusted with the
multiform curse of boarding-school affectation; and I have got the
handsomest figure, the sweetest temper, the soundest constitution, and
the kindest heart in the country. Mrs. Burns believes, as firmly as her
creed, that I am <i>le plus bel esprit, et le plus honn&ecirc;te homme</i> in the
universe; although she scarcely ever, in her life, (except reading the
Scriptures and the Psalms of David in metre) spent five minutes
together<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span> on either prose or verse. I must except also a certain late
publication of Scots Poems, which she has perused very devoutly, and all
the ballads in the country, as she has (O, the partial lover! you will
say) the finest woodnote-wild I ever heard."</p>

<p>After this, what becomes of the insinuation that Burns made an unhappy
marriage,&mdash;that he was "compelled to invest her with the control of his
life, whom he seems at first to have selected only for the gratification
of a temporary inclination;" and, "that to this circumstance much of his
misconduct is to be attributed?" Yet this, I believe, is a prevalent
impression. Those whose hearts have glowed, and whose eyes have filled
with delicious tears over the songs of Burns, have reason to be grateful
to Mr. Lockhart, and to a kindred spirit, Allan Cunningham, for the
generous feeling with which they have vindicated Burns and his Jean.
Such aspersions are not only injurious to the dead and cruel to the
living, but they do incalculable mischief:&mdash;they are food for the
flippant scoffer at all that makes the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span> 'poetry of life.' They unsettle
in gentler bosoms all faith in love, in truth, in goodness&mdash;(alas, such
disbelief comes soon enough!) they chill and revolt the heart, and "take
the rose from the fair forehead of an innocent love to set a blister
there."</p>

<p>"That Burns," says Lockhart, "ever sank into a toper, that his social
propensities ever interfered with the discharge of the duties of his
office, or that, in spite of some transitory follies, he ever ceased to
be a most affectionate husband&mdash;all these charges have been insinuated,
and they are all <i>false</i>. His aberrations of all kinds were occasional,
not systematic; they were the aberrations of a man whose moral sense was
never deadened&mdash;of one who encountered more temptations from without and
from within, than the immense majority of mankind, far from having to
contend against, are even able to imagine," and who died in his
thirty-sixth year, "ere he had reached that term of life up to which the
passions of many have proved too strong for the control of reason,
though their mortal career being regarded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span> as a whole, they are honoured
as among the most virtuous of mankind."</p>

<p>We are told also of "the conjugal and maternal tenderness, the prudence,
and the unwearied forbearance of his Jean,"&mdash;and that she had much need
of forbearance is not denied; but he ever found in her affectionate
arms, pardon and peace, and a sweetness that only made the sense of his
occasional delinquencies sting the deeper.</p>

<p>She still survives to hear her name, her early love, and her youthful
charms, warbled in the songs of her native land. He, on whom she
bestowed her beauty and her maiden truth, dying, has left to her the
mantle of his fame. What though she be now a grandmother? to the fancy,
she can never grow old, or die. We can never bring her before our
thoughts but as the lovely, graceful country girl, "lightly tripping
among the wild flowers," and warbling, "Of a' the airs the win' can
blaw,"&mdash;and this, O women, is what genius can do for you! Wherever the
adventurous spirit of her countrymen transport them, from the spicy
groves of India to the wild banks of the Mississippi,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span> the name of
Bonnie Jean is heard, bringing back to the wanderer sweet visions of
home, and of days of "Auld lang Syne." The peasant-girl sings it "at the
ewe milking," and the high-born fair breathes it to her harp and her
piano. As long as love and song shall survive, even those who have
learned to appreciate the splendid dramatic music of Germany and Italy,
who can thrill with rapture when Pasta</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>even <i>they</i> shall still have a soul for the "Banks and braes o' bonnie
Doon," still keep a corner of their hearts for truth and nature&mdash;and
Burns's Bonnie Jean.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>While my thoughts are yet with Burns,&mdash;his name before me,&mdash;my heart and
my memory still under that spell of power which his genius flings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
around him, I will add a few words on the subject of his supernumerary
loves; for he has celebrated few imaginary heroines. Of these rustic
divinities, one of the earliest, and by far the most interesting, was
Mary Campbell, (his "Highland Mary,") the object of the deepest passion
Burns ever felt; the subject of some of his loveliest songs, and of the
elegy "to Mary in Heaven."</p>

<p>Whatever this young girl may have been in person or condition, she must
have possessed some striking qualities and charms to have inspired a
passion so ardent, and regrets so lasting, in a man of Burns's
character. She was not his first love, nor his second, nor his third;
for from the age of sixteen there seems to have been no interregnum in
his fancy. His heart, he says, was "completely tinder, and eternally
lighted up by some goddess or other." His acquaintance with Mary
Campbell began when he was about two or three and twenty: he was then
residing at Mossgiel, with his brother, and she was a servant on a
neighbouring farm. Their affection was reciprocal, and they were
solemnly plighted to each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span> other. "We met," says Burns, "by appointment,
on the second Sunday in May, in a sequestered spot by the banks of the
Ayr, where we spent a day in taking a farewell, before she should embark
for the West Highlands, to arrange matters among her friends for our
projected change of life." "This adieu," say Mr. Cromek, "was performed
with all those simple and striking ceremonials which rustic sentiment
has devised to prolong tender emotions and to impose awe. The lovers
stood on each side of a small purling brook; they laved their hands in
the stream, and holding a Bible between them, pronounced their vows to
be faithful to each other." This very Bible has recently been discovered
in the possession of Mary Campbell's sister. On the boards of the Old
Testament is inscribed, in Burns's handwriting, "And ye shall not swear
by my name falsely, I am the Lord."&mdash;<i>Levit.</i> chap. xix. v. 12. On the
boards of the New Testament, "Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt
perform unto the Lord thine oaths."&mdash;<i>St. Matth.</i> chap. v. v. 33., and
his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span> own name in both. Soon afterwards, disasters came upon him, and he
thought of going to try his fortune in Jamaica. Then it was, that he
wrote the simple, wild, but powerful lyric, "Will ye go to the Indies,
my Mary?"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>As I have seen among the Alps the living stream rise, swelling and
bubbling, from some cleft in the mountain's breast, then, with a broken
and troubled impetuosity, rushing amain over all impediments,&mdash;then
leaping, at a bound, into the abyss below; so this song seems poured
forth out of the full heart, as if a gush of passion had broken forth,
that could not be restrained; and so the feeling seems to swell and
hurry through the lines, till it ends in one wild burst of energy and
pathos&mdash;</p>

<p>A few months after this "day of parting love," on the banks of the Ayr,
Mary Campbell set off from Inverary to meet her lover, as I suppose, to
take leave of him; for it should seem that no thoughts of a union could
then be indulged.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span> Having reached Greenock, she was seized with a
malignant fever, which hurried her to the grave in a few days; so that
the tidings of her death reached her lover, before he could even hear of
her illness. How deep and terrible was the shock to his strong and
ardent mind,&mdash;how lasting the memory of this early love, is well known.
Years after her death, he wrote the song of "Highland Mary."<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>The elegy to Mary in Heaven, was written about a year after his
marriage, on the anniversary of the day on which he heard of the death
of Mary Campbell. The account of the feelings and the circumstances
under which it was composed, was taken from the recital of Bonnie Jean
herself, and cannot be read without a thrill of emotion. "According to
her, Burns had spent that day, though labouring under a cold, in the
usual work of his harvest, and apparently in excellent spirits. But as
the twilight deepened, he appeared to grow 'very sad about something,'
and at length wandered out into the barn-yard, to which his wife, in her
anxiety for his health, followed him, entreating him, in vain, to
observe that frost had set in, and to return to his fire-side. On being
again and again requested to do so, he always promised compliance, but
still remained where he was, striding up and down slowly, and
contemplating the sky, which was singularly clear and starry. At last,
Mrs. Burns found him stretched on a heap of straw, with his eyes fixed
on a beautiful planet, 'that shone like another moon,' and prevailed on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
him to come in."<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> He complied; and immediately on entering the house
wrote down, as they now stand, the stanzas "To Mary in Heaven."</p>

<p>Mary Campbell was a poor peasant-girl, whose life had been spent in
servile offices, who could just spell a verse in her Bible, and could
not write at all,&mdash;who walked barefoot to that meeting on the banks of
the Ayr, which her lover has recorded. But Mary Campbell will live to
memory while the music and the language of her country endure. Helen of
Greece and the Carthage Queen are not more surely immortalised than this
plebeian girl.&mdash;The scene of parting love, on the banks of the Ayr, that
spot where "the golden hours, on angel-wings," hovered over Burns and
his Mary, is classic ground; Vaucluse and Penshurst are not more
lastingly consecrated: and like the copy of Virgil, in which Petrarch
noted down the death of Laura, which many have made a pilgrimage but to
look on, even such a relic shall be the Bible of Highland Mary. Some
far-famed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span> collection shall be proud to possess it; and many hereafter
shall gaze, with glistening eyes, on the handwriting of <i>him</i>,&mdash;who by
the mere power of truth and passion, shall live in all hearts to the end
of time.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Some other loves commemorated by Burns are not very interesting or
reputable. "The lassie wi' the lint white locks," the heroine of many
beautiful songs, was an erring sister, who, as she was the object of a
poet's admiration, shall be suffered to fade into a shadow. The subject
of the song,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Had we never lov'd sae kindly&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Had we never lov'd sae blindly&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Never met&mdash;or never parted&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We had ne'er been broken-hearted,<br /></span>

<p>was also real, and I am afraid, a person of the same description. Of
these four lines, Sir Walter Scott has said, "that they were worth a
thousand romances;" and not only so, but they are in themselves a
complete romance. They are the <i>alpha</i> and <i>omega</i> of feeling; and
contain the essence of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span> an existence of pain and pleasure, distilled
into one burning drop. Of almost all his songs, the heroines are real,
though we must not suppose he was in love with them all,&mdash;that were too
unconscionable; but he sometimes sought inspiration, and found it, where
he could not have hoped any farther boon. In one of his letters to Mr.
Thompson, for whose collection of Scottish airs he was then adapting
words, he says, "Whenever I want to be more than ordinary <i>in song</i>, to
be in some degree equal to your divine airs, do you imagine I fast and
pray for the celestial emanation?&mdash;<i>tout au contraire</i>. I have a
glorious recipe, the very one that, for his own use, was invented by the
divinity of healing and poetry, when erst he piped to the flocks of
Admetus,&mdash;I put myself on a regimen of admiring a fine woman."</p>

<p>Thus, the original blue eyes which inspired that sweet song, "Her ee'n
sae bonnie blue," belonged to a Miss Jeffreys, now married, and living
at New York. We owe "She's fair and she's false," to the fickleness of a
Miss Jane Stuart,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span> who, it is said, jilted the poet's friend, Alexander
Cunningham.&mdash;"The bonnie wee thing," was a very little, very lovely
creature, a Miss Davies; and the song, it has been well said, is as
brief and as beautiful as the lady herself. The heroine of "O saw ye
bonnie Leslie," is now Mrs. Cumming of Logie: Mrs. Dugald Stewart,
herself a delightful poetess, inspired the pastoral song of Afton Water;
and every woman has an interest in "Green grow the Rushes." All the
compliments that were ever paid us by the other sex, in prose and verse,
may be summed up in Burns's line,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">What signifies the life o' man, an' 't were na for the lasses O?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It were, however, an endless task to give a list of his heroines; and
those who are curious about the personal history of the poet, of which
his songs are "part and parcel," must be referred to higher and more
general sources of information.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>Burns used to say, after he had been introduced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span> into society above his
own rank in life, that he saw nothing in the <i>gentlemen</i> much superior
to what he had been accustomed to; but that a refined and elegant woman
was a being of whom he could have formed no previous idea. This, I
think, will explain, if it does not excuse, the characteristic freedom
of some of his songs. His love is ardent and sincere, and it is
expressed with great poetic power, and often with the most exquisite
pathos; but still it is the love of a peasant for a peasant, and he
wooes his rustic beauties in a style of the most entire equality and
familiarity. It is not the homage of one who waited, a suppliant, on the
throne of triumphant beauty. "He drew no magic circle of lofty and
romantic thought around those he loved, which could not be passed
without lowering them from stations little lower than the angels."<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
Still, his faults against taste and propriety are far fewer and lighter
than might have been expected from his habits; and as he acknowledged
that he could have formed no idea of a woman refined by high<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span> breeding
and education, we cannot be surprised if he sometimes committed
solecisms of which he was scarcely aware. For instance, he met a young
lady (Miss Alexander, of Ballochmyle,) walking in her father's grounds,
and struck by her charms and elegance, he wrote in her honour his well
known song, "The lovely lass of Ballochmyle," and sent it to her. He was
astonished and offended that no notice was taken of it; but really, a
young lady, educated in a due regard for the <i>convenances</i> and the
<i>biens&eacute;ances</i> of society, may be excused, if she was more embarrassed
than flattered by the homage of a poet, who talked, at the first glance,
of "clasping her to his bosom." It was rather precipitating things.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3>CONJUGAL POETRY CONTINUED.</h3>

<h3>MONTI AND HIS WIFE.</h3>


<p>Monti, who is lately dead, will at length be allowed to take the place
which belongs to him among the great names of his country. A poet is ill
calculated to play the part of a politician; and the praise and blame
which have been so profusely and indiscriminately heaped on Monti while
living, must be removed by time and dispassionate criticism, before
justice can be done to him, either as a man or a poet. The mingled grace
and energy of his style obtained him the name of <i>il Dante grazioso</i>,
and he has left behind him something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span> striking in every possible form of
composition,&mdash;lyric, dramatic, epic, and satirical.</p>

<p>Amid all the changes of his various life, and all the trying
vicissitudes of spirits&mdash;the wear and tear of mind which attend a poet
by profession, tasked to almost constant exertion, Monti possessed two
enviable treasures;&mdash;a lovely and devoted wife, with a soul which could
appreciate his powers and talents, and exult in his fame; and a daughter
equally amiable, and yet more beautiful and highly gifted. He has
immortalised both; and has left us delightful proofs of the charm and
the glory which poetry can throw round the purest and most hallowed
relations of domestic life.</p>

<p>When Monti was a young man at Rome, caressed by popes and nephews of
popes, and with the most brilliant ecclesiastical preferment opening
before him, all his views in life were at once <i>boulevers&eacute;</i> by a
passion, which does sometimes in real life play the part assigned to it
in romance&mdash;trampling on interest and ambition, and mocking at
Cardinals' hats and tiaras. Monti fell into love, and fell out of the
good graces of his patrons: he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span> threw off the habit of an <i>abbate</i>,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
married his Teresa, in spite of the world and fortune; and instead of an
aspiring priest, became a great poet.</p>

<p>Teresa Pichler was the daughter of Pichler, the celebrated gem engraver.
I have heard her described, by those who knew her in her younger years,
as one of the most beautiful creatures in the world. Brought up in the
studio of her father, in whom the spirit of ancient art seemed to have
revived for modern times, Teresa's mind as well as person had caught a
certain impress of antique grace, from the constant presence of
beautiful and majestic forms: but her favourite study was music, in
which she was a proficient; her voice and her harp made as many
conquests as her faultless figure and her bright eyes. After her
marriage she did not neglect her favourite art; and she, whose talent
had charmed Zingarelli and Guglielmi, was accustomed, in their hours of
domestic privacy, to soothe, to enchant, to inspire, her husband. Monti,
in one of his poems, has tenderly commemorated her musical powers. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
calls on his wife during a period of persecution, poverty and
despondency, to touch her harp, and, as she was wont, rouse his sinking
spirit, and unlock the source of nobler thoughts.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Stendi, dolce amor mio! sposa diletta!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A quell' arpa la man; che la soave,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Dolce fatica di tue dite aspetta.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Svegliami l'armonia, ch' entro le cave<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Latebre alberga del sonoro legno,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">E de' forti pensier volgi la chiave!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is a resemblance in the <i>sentiment</i> of these verses, to some
stanzas addressed by a living English poet to his wife;&mdash;she who, like
Monti's Teresa, can strike her harp, till, as a spirit caught in some
spell of his own teaching, music itself seems to flutter, imprisoned
among the chords,&mdash;to come at her will and breathe her thought, rather
than obey her touch!&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Once more, among those rich and golden strings,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Wander with thy white arm, dear Lady pale!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And when at last from thy sweet discord springs<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The aerial music,&mdash;like the dreams that veil<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Earth's shadows with diviner thoughts and things,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">O let the passion and the time prevail!&mdash;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
<span class="i2">O bid thy spirit through the mazes run!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For music is like love, and must be won! &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Italian verses have great power and beauty; but the English lines
have the superiority, not in poetry only, but in rhythmical melody. They
fall on the ear like a strain from the harp which inspired them&mdash;full,
and rich, and thrilling sweet,&mdash;and not to be forgotten!</p>

<p>To return to Monti:&mdash;no man had more completely that temperament which
is supposed to accompany genius. He was fond, and devoted in his
domestic relations; but he was variable in spirits, ardent, restless,
and subject to fits of gloom. And how often must the literary disputes
and political <i>tracasseries</i> in which he was engaged, have embittered
and irritated so susceptible a mind and temper! If his wife were at his
side to soothe him with her music, and her smiles, and her
tenderness,&mdash;it was well,&mdash;the cloud passed away. If she were absent,
every suffering seemed aggravated, and we find him&mdash;like one spoiled and
pampered, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span> attention and love,&mdash;yielding to an irritable
despondency, which even the presence of his children could not
alleviate.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Che pi&ugrave; ti resta a far per mio dispetto,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sorte crudel? mia donna &egrave; lungi, e io privo,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">De' suoi conforti in miserando aspetto<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Egro qui giacc&igrave;o, al' sofferir sol vivo!<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But the most remarkable of all Monti's conjugal effusions, is a canzone
written a short time before his death, and when he was more than seventy
years of age. Nothing can be more affecting than the subdued tone of
melancholy tenderness, with which the grey-haired poet apostrophises her
who had been the love, the pride, the joy of his life for forty years.
In power and in poetry, this canzone will bear a comparison with many of
the more rapturous effusions of his youth. The occasion on which it was
composed is thus related in a note prefixed to it by the editor.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
When Monti was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span> recovering from a long and dangerous illness, through
which he had been tenderly nursed by his wife and daughter, he
accompanied them "in villeggiatura," to a villa near Brianza, the
residence of a friend, where they were accustomed to celebrate the
birth-day of Madame Monti; and it was here that her husband, now
declining in years, weak from recent illness and accumulated
infirmities, addressed to her the poem which may be found in the recent
edition of his works; it begins thus tenderly and sweetly&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Donna! dell' alma mia parte pi&ugrave; cara!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Perch&egrave; muta in pensosa atto mi guati?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">E di segrete stille,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Rugiadose si fan le tue pupille? &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Why, O thou dearer half of my soul, dost thou watch over me thus mute
and pensive? Why are thine eyes heavy with suppressed tears?" &amp;c.</p>

<p>And when he reminds her touchingly, that his long and troubled life is
drawing to its natural close, and that she cannot hope to retain him
much longer, even by all her love and care,&mdash;he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span> adds with a noble
spirit,&mdash;"Remember, that Monti cannot wholly die! think, O think! I
leave thee dowered with no obscure, no vulgar name! for the day shall
come, when, among the matrons of Italy, it shall be thy boast to
say,&mdash;"I was the love of Monti.""<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>The tender transition to his daughter&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">E tu del pari sventurata e cara mia figlia!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>as alike unhappy and beloved, alludes to her recent widowhood. Costanza
Monti, who inherited no small portion of her fathers genius, and all her
mother's grace and beauty, married the Count Giulio Perticari of Pesaro,
a man of uncommon taste and talents, and an admired poet. He died in the
same year with Canova, to whom he had been a favourite friend and
companion: while his lovely wife furnished the sculptor with a model for
his ideal heads of vestals and poetesses. Those who saw the Countess
Perticari at Rome, such as she appeared seven or eight years ago, will
not easily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span> forget her brilliant eyes, and yet more brilliant talents.
She, too, is a poetess. In her father's works may be found a little
canzone written by her about a year after the death of her husband, and
with equal tenderness and simplicity, alluding to her lonely state,
deprived of him who once encouraged and cultivated her talents, and
deserved her love.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>Vincenzo Monti died in October 1828:&mdash;his widow and his daughter reside,
I believe, at Milan.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<h3>POETS AND BEAUTIES,</h3>

<h4>FROM CHARLES II. TO QUEEN ANNE.</h4>


<p>Thus, then, it appears, that love, even the most ethereal and poetical,
does not always take flight "at sight of human ties;" and Pope wronged
the real delicacy of Helo&iuml;se when he put this borrowed sentiment into
her epistle, making that conduct the result of perverted principle,
which, in <i>her</i>, was a sacrifice to extreme love and pride in its
object. It is not the mere idea of bondage which frightens away the
light-winged god;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">The gentle bird feels no captivity<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Within his cage, but sings and feeds his fill.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>
<p>It is when those bonds, which were first decreed in heaven</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">To keep two hearts together, which began<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Their spring-time with one love,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>are abused to vilest purposes:&mdash;to link together indissolubly,
unworthiness with desert, truth with falsehood, brutality with
gentleness; then indeed love is scared; his cage becomes a dungeon;&mdash;and
either he breaks away, with plumage all impaired,&mdash;or folds up his
many-coloured wings, and droops and dies.</p>

<p>But then it will be said, perhaps, that the splendour and the charm
which poetry has thrown over some of these pictures of conjugal
affection and wedded truth, are exterior and adventitious, or, at best,
short-lived:&mdash;the bands were at first graceful and flowery;&mdash;but sorrow
dewed them with tears, or selfish passions sullied them, or death tore
them asunder, or trampled them down. It may be so; but still I will aver
that what has been, <i>is</i>:&mdash;that there is a power in the human heart
which survives sorrow, passion, age, death itself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Love I esteem more strong than age,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And truth more permanent than time.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>For happiness, <i>c'est different!</i> and for that bright and pure and
intoxicating happiness which we weave into our youthful visions, which
is of such stuff as dreams are made of,&mdash;to complain that this does not
last and wait upon us through life, is to complain that earth is
<i>earth</i>, not heaven. It is to repine that the violet does not outlive
the spring; that the rose dies upon the breast of June; that the grey
evening shuts up the eye of day, and that old age quenches the glow of
youth: for is not such the condition under which we exist? All I wished
to prove was, that the sacred tie which binds the sexes together, which
gives to man his natural refuge in the tenderness of woman, and to woman
her natural protecting stay in the right reason and stronger powers of
man, so far from being a chill to the imagination, as wicked wits would
tell us, has its poetical side. Let us look back for a moment on the
array of bright names and beautiful verse, quoted or alluded to in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
preceding chapters: what is there among the mercurial poets of Charles's
days, those notorious scoffers at decency and constancy, to compare with
them?&mdash;Dorset and Denham, and Sedley and Suckling, and Rochester,&mdash;"the
mob of gentlemen who wrote with ease,"&mdash;with their smooth emptiness, and
sparkling common-places of artificial courtship, and total want of moral
sentiment, have degraded, not elevated the loves they sang. Could these
gallant fops rise up from their graves, and see themselves exiled with
contempt from every woman's toilet, every woman's library, every woman's
memory, they would choak themselves with their own periwigs, eat their
laced cravats, hang themselves in their own sword-knots!&mdash;"to be
discarded thence!"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">Turn thy complexion there,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thou simpering, smooth-lipp'd cherub, Coxcombry,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ay, there, look grim as hell!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And such be the fate of all who dare profane the altar of beauty with
adulterate incense!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">For wit is like the frail luxuriant vine,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Unless to virtue's prop it join;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Though it with beauteous leaves and pleasant fruit be crown'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It lies deform'd and rotting on the ground!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These lines are from Cowley,&mdash;a great name among the poets of those
days; but he has sunk into a <i>name</i>. We may repeat with Pope, "Who now
reads Cowley?" and this, not because he was licentious, but because,
with all his elaborate wit, and brilliant and uncommon thoughts, he is
as frigid as ice itself. "A little ingenuity and artifice," as Mrs.
Malaprop would say, is well enough; but Cowley, in his amatory poetry,
is all artifice. He coolly sat down to write a volume of love verses,
that he might, to use his own expression, "be free of his craft, as a
poet;" and in his preface, he protests "that his testimony should not be
taken against himself." Here was a poet, and a lover! who sets out by
begging his readers, in the first place, not to believe him. This was
like the weaver, in the Midsummer Night's Dream, who was so anxious to
assure his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span> audience "that Pyramus was not killed indeed, and that he,
Pyramus, was not Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver." But Cowley's amatory
verse disproves itself, without the help of a prologue. It is, in his
own phrase, "all sophisticate." Even his sparkling chronicle of
beauties,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Margaretta first possest,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If I remember well, my breast, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>is mere fancy, and in truth it is a pity. Cowley was once in love, after
his querulous melancholy fashion; but he never had the courage to avow
it. The lady alluded to in the last verse of the Chronicle, as</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Eleonora, first of the name,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whom God grant long to reign,<br /></span>

brother of Dr. Spratt, Bishop of Rochester,<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> who had not probably
half the poet's wit or fame, but who could love as well, and speak
better; and the gentle, amiable Cowley died an old batchelor.</p>

<p>These writers may have merit of a different kind; they may be read by
wits for the sake of their wit; but they have failed in the great object
of lyric poetry: they neither create sympathy for themselves; nor
interest, nor respect for their mistresses: they were not in
earnest;&mdash;and what woman of sense and feeling was ever touched by a
compliment which no woman ever inspired? or pleased, by being addressed
with the swaggering licence of a libertine? Who cares to inquire after
the originals of their Belindas and Clorindas&mdash;their Chloes, Delias, and
Phillises, with their pastoral names, and loves&mdash;that were any thing but
pastoral? There is not one among the flaunting coquettes, or profligate
women of fashion, sung by these gay coxcomb poets&mdash;</p>

<p>who has obtained an interest in our memory, or a permanent place in the

Jean, or Highland Mary! It is true, that the age produced several
remarkable women; a Lady Russell, that heroine of heroines! a Lady
Fanshawe;<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> a Mrs. Hutchinson; who needed no poet to trumpet forth
their praise: and others,&mdash;some celebrated for the possession of beauty
and talents, and too many notorious for the abuse of both. But there
were no poetical heroines, properly so called,&mdash;no Laura, no Geraldine,
no Saccharissa. Among the temporary idols of the day, (by which name we
shall distinguish those women whose beauty, rank, and patronage,
procured them a sort of poetical celebrity, very different from the halo
of splendour which love and genius cast round a chosen divinity,) there
are one or two who deserve to be particularised.</p>

<p>The first of these was Maria Beatrice d'Este, the daughter of the Duke
of Modena, second wife of James Duke of York, and afterwards his queen.
She was married, at the age of fifteen, to a profligate prince, as ugly
as his brother Charles, (without any of his captivating graces of figure
and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span> manner,) and old enough to be her grandfather. She made the best of
wives to one of the most unamiable of men. All writers of all parties
are agreed, that slander itself, was disarmed by the unoffending
gentleness of her character; all are agreed too, on the subject of her
uncommon loveliness: she was quite an Italian beauty, with a tall,
dignified, graceful figure, regular features, and dark eyes, a
complexion rather pale and fair, and hair and eyebrows black as the
raven's wing: so that in personal graces, as in virtues, she fairly
justified the rapturous eulogies of all the poets of her time. Thus
Dryden:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">What awful charms on her fair forehead sit,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Dispensing what she never will admit;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Pleasing yet cold&mdash;like Cynthia's silver beam,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The people's wonder, and the poet's theme!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She captivated hearts almost as fast as James the Second lost them;</p>

retirement at St. Germains, with a dull court, and a stupid bigoted
husband; are all matters of history, and might have inspired, one would
think, better verses than were ever written upon her. Lord Lansdown
exclaims, with an enthusiasm which was at least disinterested&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>Anne Killegrew, who has been immortalised by Dryden, in the ode,<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>does not seem to have possessed any talents or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span> acquirements which would
render her <i>very</i> remarkable in these days; though in her own time she
was styled "a grace for beauty and a muse for wit." Her youth, her
accomplishments, her captivating person, her station at court, (as maid
of honour to Maria d'Este, then Duchess of York,) and her premature
death at the age of twenty-four, all conspired to render her interesting
to her contemporaries; and Dryden has given her a fame which cannot die.

<p>are exceedingly beautiful. His description of her skill in painting both
landscape and portraits, would answer for a Claude, or a Titian. We are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
a little disappointed to find, after all this pomp and prodigality of
praise, that Anne Killegrew's paintings were mediocre; and that her
poetry has sunk, not undeservedly, into oblivion. She died of the
small-pox in 1685.</p>

<p>The famous Tom Killegrew, jester (by courtesy) to Charles the Second,
was her uncle.</p>

<p>There was also the young Duchess of Ormond, (Lady Mary Somerset,
daughter of the Duke of Beaufort.) She married into a family which had
been, for three generations, the patrons and benefactors of Dryden; and
never was patronage so richly repaid. To this Duchess of Ormond, Dryden
has dedicated the Tale of Palemon and Arcite, in an opening address full
of poetry and compliment;&mdash;happily, both justified and merited by the
object.</p>

<p>Lady Hyde, afterwards Countess of Clarendon and Rochester, was in her
time a favourite theme of gay and gallant verse; but she maintained with
her extreme beauty and gentleness of deportment, a dignity of conduct
which disarmed scandal, and kept presumptuous wits as well as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
presumptuous fops at a distance. Lord Lansdown has crowned her with
praise, very pointed and elegant, and seems to have contrasted her at
the moment, with his coquettish Mira, Lady Newburgh.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Lady Hyde was the daughter of Sir William Leveson Gower, (ancestor to
the Marquis of Stafford,) and mother of that Lord Cornbury, who has been
celebrated by Pope and Thomson.</p>

<p>The second daughter of this lovely and amiable woman, lady Catherine
Hyde, was Prior's famous Kitty,</p>

<p>Kitty not only set the world on fire, but more than accomplished her
magnanimous resolution to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span> have an Earl as well as her sister, Lady
Jenny.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> She married the Duke of Queensbury; and as <i>that</i> Duchess of
Queensbury, who was the friend and patroness of Gay, is still farther
connected with the history of our poetical literature. Pope paid a
compliment to her beauty, in a well-known couplet, which is more refined
in the application than in the expression:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">If Queensbury to strip there's no compelling,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'Tis from a handmaid we must take a Helen.<br /></span>

<p>She was an amiable, exemplary woman, and possessed that best and only
preservative of youth and beauty,&mdash;a kind, cheerful disposition and
buoyant spirits. When she walked at the coronation of George the Third,
she was still so strikingly attractive, that Horace Walpole handed to
her the following impromptu, written on a leaf of his pocket-book,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">To many a Kitty, Love, his car,<br /></span>

<p>The Duchess of Queensbury died in 1777.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>Two other women, who lived about the same time, possess a degree of
celebrity which, though but a sound&mdash;a name&mdash;rather than a feeling or an
interest, must not pass unnoticed; more particularly as they will
farther illustrate the theory we have hitherto kept in view. I allude to
"Granville's Mira," and "Prior's Chloe."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>
<p>For the fame of the first, a single line of Pope has done more than all
the verses of Lord Lansdown: it is in the Epistle to Jervas the
painter&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">With Zeuxis' Helen, thy Bridgewater vie,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And these be sung, till Granville's Mira die!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Now, "Granville's Mira" would have been <i>dead</i> long ago, had she not
been preserved in some material more precious and lasting than the
poetry of her noble admirer: she shines, however, "embalmed in the lucid
amber" of Pope's lines; and we not only wonder how she got there, but
are tempted to inquire who she was, or, if ever she was at all.</p>

<p>Granville's Mira was Lady Frances Brudenel, third daughter of the Earl
of Cardigan. She was married very young to Livingstone, Earl of
Newburgh; and Granville's first introduction to her must have taken
place soon after her marriage, in 1690: he was then about twenty,
already distinguished for that elegance of mind and manner, which has
handed him down to us as "Granville the polite." He joined the crowd of
Lady Newburgh's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span> adorers; and as some praise, and some lucky lines had
persuaded him that he was a poet, he chose to consecrate his verse to
this fashionable beauty.</p>

<p>In all the mass of poetry, or rather rhyme, addressed to Lady Newburgh,
there is not a passage,&mdash;not a single line which can throw an interest
round her character; all we can make out is, that she was extremely
beautiful; that she sang well; and that she was a most finished,
heartless coquette. Thus her lover has pictured her:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Lost in a labyrinth of doubts and joys,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whom now her smiles revived, her scorn destroys;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She will, and she will not, she grants, denies,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Consents, retracts; advances, and then flies.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Approving and rejecting in a breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now proffering mercy, now presenting death!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She led Granville on from year to year, till the death of her first
husband, Lord Newburgh. He then presented himself among the suitors for
her hand, confiding, it seems, in former encouragement or promises; but
Lady Newburgh had played the same despicable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span> game with others: she had
no objection to the poetical admiration of an accomplished young man of
fashion, who had rendered her an object of universal attention, by his
determined pursuit and tuneful homage, and who was then the admired of
all women. She thought, like the coquette, in one of Congreve's
comedies,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">If there's delight in love, 'tis when I see<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The heart that others bleed for&mdash;bleed for me!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But when free to choose, she rejected him and married Lord Bellew. Her
coquetry with Granville had been so notorious, that this marriage caused
a great sensation at the time and no little scandal.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Rumour is loud, and every voice proclaims<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Her violated faith and conscious flames.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The only catastrophe, however, which her falsehood occasioned, was the
production of a long elegy, in imitation of Theocritus, which concludes
Lord Lansdown's amatory effusions. He afterwards married Lady Anne
Villiers, with whom he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span> lived happily: after a union of more than twenty
years, they died within a few days of each other, and they were buried
together.</p>

<p>Lady Newburgh left a daughter by her first husband,<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> and a son and
daughter by Lord Bellew: she lived to survive her beauty, to lose her
admirers, and to be the object in her old age of the most gross and
unmeasured satire; the flattery of a lover elevated her to a divinity,
and the malice of a wit, whom she had ill-treated, degraded her into a
fury and a hag&mdash;with about as much reason.</p>

<p>Prior's Chloe, the "nut-brown maid," was taken from the opposite
extremity of society, but could scarce have been more worthless. She was
a common woman of the lowest description, whose real name was, I
believe, Nancy Derham,&mdash;but it is not a matter of much importance.</p>

<p>Prior's attachment to this woman, however unmerited, was very sincere.
For her sake he quitted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span> the high society into which his talents and his
political connexions had introduced him; and for her, he neglected, as
he tells us&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Whate'er the world thinks wise and grave,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ambition, business, friendship, news,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My useful books and serious muse,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>to bury himself with her in some low tavern for weeks together. Once
when they quarrelled, she ran away and carried off his plate; but even
this could not shake his constancy: at his death he left her all he
possessed, and she&mdash;his Chloe&mdash;at whose command and in whose honour he
wrote his "Henry and Emma,"&mdash;married a cobler!<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Such was Prior's
Chloe.</p>

<p>Is it surprising that the works of a poet once so popular, should now be
banished from a Lady's library?&mdash;a banishment from which all his
sprightly wit cannot redeem him.&mdash;But because Prior's love for this
woman was real, and that he was really a man of feeling and genius,
though debased by low and irregular habits, there are some sweet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
touches scattered through his poetry, which show how strong was the
illusion in his fancy:&mdash;as in "Chloe Jealous."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Reading thy verse, "who cares," said I,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">"If here or there his glances flew?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">O free for ever be his eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Whose heart to me is always true!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And in his "Answer to Chloe Jealous."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">O when I am wearied with wandering all day,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To thee, my delight, in the evening I come.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No matter what beauties I saw in my way,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">They were but my visits, but thou art my home!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The address to Chloe, with which the "Nut-brown Maid" commences,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Thou, to whose eyes I bend, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>will ever be admired, and the poem will always find readers among the
young and gentle-hearted, who have not yet learned to be critics or to
tremble at the fiat of Dr. Johnson. It is perhaps one of the most
popular poems in the language.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<h3>STELLA AND VANESSA.</h3>


<p>It is difficult to consider Swift as a poet. So many unamiable,
disagreeable, unpoetical ideas are connected with his name, that, great
as he was in fame and intellectual vigour, he seems as misplaced in the
temple of the muses as one of his own yahoos. But who has not heard of
"Swift's Stella?" and of Cadenus and Vanessa? Though all will confess
that the two devoted women, who fell victims to his barbarous
selfishness, and whose names are eternally linked with the history of
our literature, are far more interesting, from their ill-bestowed,
ill-requited and passionate attachment to <i>him</i>, than by any thing he
ever sung<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span> or said of <i>them</i>.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Nay, his longest, his most elaborate,
and his most admired poem&mdash;the avowed history of one of his
attachments&mdash;with its insipid tawdry fable, its conclusion, in which
nothing is concluded, and the inferences we are left to draw from it,
would have given but an ignominious celebrity to poor Vanessa, if truth
and time, and her own sweet nature, had not redeemed her.</p>

<p>I pass over Swift's early attachment to Jane Waryng, whom he deserted
after a seven years' engagement: she is not in any way connected with
his literary history,&mdash;and what became of her afterwards is not known.
He excused himself by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span> some pitiful subterfuges about fortune; but it
appears, from a comparison of dates, that the occasion of his breaking
off with her, was his rising partiality for another.</p>

<p>When Swift was an inmate of Sir William Temple's family at Moor Park, he
met with Esther Johnson, who appears to have been a kind of humble
companion to Sir William's niece, Miss Gifford. She is said by some to
have been the daughter of Sir William's steward; by others we are told
that her father was a London merchant, who had failed in business. This
was the interesting and ill-fated woman, since renowned as "Swift's
Stella."</p>

<p>She was then a blooming girl of fifteen, with silky black hair,
brilliant eyes, and delicate features. Her disposition was gentle and
affectionate; and she had a mind of no common order. Swift sometimes
employed his leisure in instructing Sir William's niece, and Stella was
the companion of her studies. Her beauty, talents, and docility,
interested her preceptor, who, though considerably older than herself,
was in the vigour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span> of his life and intellectual powers; and she repaid
this interest with all the idolatry of a young unpractised heart,
mingled with a gratitude and reverence almost filial. When he took
possession of his living in Ireland, he might have married her; for she
loved him, and he knew it. She was perfectly independent of any family
ties, and had a small property of her own: but what were really his
views or his intentions, it is impossible to guess; nor at the reasons
of that most extraordinary arrangement, by which he contrived to bind
this devoted creature to him for life, and to enslave her heart and soul
to him for ever, without assuming the character either of a husband or a
lover. He persuaded her to leave England; and, under the sanction and
protection of a respectable elderly woman named Dingley, often alluded
to in his humorous poems, to take up her residence near him at Laracor.
Subsequently, when he became Dean of St. Patrick's, she had a lodging in
Dublin. He was accustomed to spend part of every day in her society, but
never without the presence of a third person; and when he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span> was absent,
the two ladies took possession of his residence, and occupied it till
his return.</p>

<p>Two years after her removal to Ireland, and when she was in her
twentieth year, Stella was addressed by a young clergyman, whose name
was Tisdal; and sensible of the humiliating and equivocal situation in
which she was placed, and unable to bring Swift to any explanation of
his views or sentiments, she appears to have been inclined to favour the
addresses of her new admirer. He proposed in form; but Swift, without in
any way committing himself, contrived to prevent the marriage. Stella
found herself precisely in the same situation as before, and every year
increased his influence over her young and gentle spirit, as habit
confirmed and strengthened the bonds of a first affection. She lived on
in the hope that he would at length marry her; bearing his sullen
outbreakings of temper, soothing his morbid misanthropy, cheering and
adorning his life; and giving herself every day fresh claims to his
love, compassion, and gratitude, by her sufferings, her virtues, her
patient gentleness, and her exclusive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span> devotion;&mdash;and all availed not!
During this extraordinary connection, Swift was accustomed to address
her in verse. Some of these poems, though worthless as poetry, derive
interest from the beauty of her character, and from that concentrated
vigour of expression which was the characteristic of all he wrote; as in
this descriptive passage:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Her hearers are amazed from whence<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Proceeds that fund of wit and sense,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which, though her modesty would shroud,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Breaks like the sun behind a cloud;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">While gracefulness its art conceals,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And yet through every motion steals.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Say, Stella, was Prometheus blind,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And forming you, mistook your kind?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No; 'twas for you alone he stole<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The fire that forms a manly soul;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then, to complete it every way,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He moulded it with female clay:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To <i>that</i> you owe the nobler flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To <i>this</i> the beauty of your frame.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He compliments her sincerity and firmness of principle in four nervous
lines:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Ten thousand oaths upon record<br /></span>

<span class="i2">The world shall in its atoms end,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ere Stella can deceive a friend!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Her tender attention to him in sickness and suffering, is thus
described, with a tolerable insight into his own character.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">To her I owe<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That I these pains can undergo;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She tends me like an humble slave,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">When out my brutish passions break,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With gall in every word I speak,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She, with soft speech, my anguish cheers,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or melts my passions down with tears:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Although 'tis easy to descry<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She wants assistance more than I,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She seems to feel my pains alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And is a Stoic to her own.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where, among scholars, can you find<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So soft, and yet so firm a mind?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These lines, dated March, 1724, are the more remarkable, because they
refer to a period when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span> Stella had much to forgive;&mdash;when she had just
been injured, in the tenderest point, by the man who owed to her
tenderness and forbearance all the happiness that his savage temper
allowed him to taste on earth.</p>

<p>As Stella passed much of her time in solitude, she read a great deal.
She received Swift's friends, many of whom were clever and distinguished
men, particularly Sheridan and Delany; and on his public days she dined
as a guest at his table, where, says his biographer,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> "the modesty
of her manners, the sweetness of her disposition, and the brilliance of
her wit, rendered her the general object of admiration to all who were
so happy as to have a place in that enviable society."</p>

<p>Johnson says that, "if Swift's ideas of women were such as he generally
exhibits, a very little sense in a lady would enrapture, and a very
little virtue astonish him;" and thinks, therefore, that Stella's
supremacy might be "only local and comparative;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span> but it is not the less
true, that she was beheld with tenderness and admiration by all who
approached her; and whether she could spell or not,<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> she could
certainly write very pretty verses, considering whom she had chosen for
her model:&mdash;for instance, the following little effusion, in reply to a
compliment addressed to her:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">If it be true, celestial powers,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">That you have formed me fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And yet, in all my vainest hours,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">My mind has been my care;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then, in return, I beg this grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">As you were ever kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What envious time takes from my face,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Bestow upon my mind!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She had continued to live on in this strange undefinable state of
dependance for fourteen years, "in pale contented sort of discontent,"
though her spirit was so borne down by the habitual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span> awe in which he
held her, that she never complained&mdash;when the suspicion that a younger
and fairer rival had usurped the heart she possessed, if not the rights
she coveted, added the tortures of jealousy to those of lingering
suspense and mortified affection.</p>

<p>A new attachment had, in fact, almost entirely estranged Swift from her,
and from his home. While in London, from 1710 to 1712, he was accustomed
to visit at the house of Mrs. Vanhomrigh, and became so intimate, that
during his attendance on the ministry at that time, he was accustomed to
change his wig and gown, and drink his coffee there almost daily. Mrs.
Vanhomrigh had two daughters: the eldest, Esther, was destined to be the
second victim of Swift's detestable selfishness, and become celebrated
under the name of Vanessa.</p>

<p>She was of a character altogether different from that of Stella. Not
quite so beautiful in person, but with all the freshness and vivacity of
youth&mdash;(she was not twenty,) and adding to the advantages of polished
manners and lively talents,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span> a frank confiding temper, and a capacity
for strong affections. She was rich, admired, happy, and diffusing
happiness. Swift, as I have said, visited at the house of her mother.
His age, his celebrity, his character as a clergyman, gave him
privileges of which he availed himself. He was pleased with Miss
Vanhomrigh's talents, and undertook to direct her studies. She was
ignorant of the ties which bound him to the unhappy Stella; and charmed
by his powers of conversation, dazzled by his fame, won and flattered by
his attentions, surrendered her heart and soul to him before she was
aware; and her love partaking of the vivacity of her character, not only
absorbed every other feeling, but, as she expressed it herself, "became
blended with every atom of her frame."<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>Swift, among his other lessons, took pains to impress her with his own
favourite maxims (it had been well for both had he acted up to them
himself)&mdash;"to speak the truth on all occasions, and at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span> every hazard:
and to do what seemed right in itself, without regard to the opinions or
customs of the world." He appears also to have insinuated the idea, that
the disparity of their age and fortune rendered him distrustful of his
own powers of pleasing.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> She was thus led on, by his open
admiration, and her own frank temper, to betray the state of her
affections, and proffered to him her hand and fortune. He had not
sufficient humanity, honour, or courage, to disclose the truth of his
situation, but replied to the avowal of this innocent and warm-hearted
girl, first in a tone of raillery, and then by an equivocal offer of
everlasting friendship.</p>

<p>The scene is thus given in Cadenus and Vanessa.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Vanessa, though by Pallas taught,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Cadenus many things had writ;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Vanessa much esteemed his wit,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And call'd for his poetic works.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Mean time the boy in secret lurks;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And, while the book was in her hand<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The urchin from his private stand<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Took aim, and shot with all his strength<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A dart of such prodigious length,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It pierced the feeble volume through,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And deep transfix'd her bosom too.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Some lines, more moving than the rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Stuck to the point that pierced her breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And borne directly to the heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With pains unknown, increas'd her smart.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Vanessa, not in years a score,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Dreams of a gown of forty-four;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Imaginary charms can find,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In eyes with reading almost blind.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Cadenus now no more appears<br /></span>

<span class="i2">She fancies music in his tongue,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor farther looks, but thinks him young.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Vanessa is then made to disclose her tenderness. The expressions and the
sentiments are probably as true to the facts as was consistent with the
rhyme:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span> but how cold, how flat, how prosaic! no emotion falters in the
lines&mdash;not a feeling blushes through them!&mdash;as if an ardent but delicate
and gentle girl would ever have made a first avowal of passion in this
<i>chop-logic</i> style&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It is possible he might have felt thus; and yet the excess of his
<i>surprise</i> and <i>disappointment</i> on the occasion, may be doubted. He
makes, however, a very candid confession of his own vanity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Just what coxcombs call a bite.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>(such is his elegant phrase.) He then offers her friendship instead of
love: the lady replies with very pertinent arguments; and finally, the
tale is concluded in this ambiguous passage, in which we must allow that
great room is left for scandal, for doubt, and for curiosity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">But what success Vanessa met<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Such is the story of this celebrated poem. The passion, the
circumstances, the feelings are real, and it contains lines of great
power; and yet, assuredly, the perusal of it never conveyed one emotion
to the reader's heart, except of indignation against the writer; not a
spark of poetry, fancy, or pathos, breathes throughout. We have a dull
mythological fable in which Venus and the Graces descend to clothe
Vanessa in all the attractions of her sex:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">The Graces next would act their part,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">That gentle, soft, engaging air,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which in old times advanced the fair.<br /></span>

<p>And Pallas is tricked by the wiles of Venus into doing <i>her</i> part.&mdash;The
Queen of Learning</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Mistakes Vanessa for a boy;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then sows within her tender mind<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Seeds long unknown to womankind,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">The seeds of knowledge, judgment, wit.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Her soul was suddenly endued<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With justice, truth, and fortitude,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With honour, which no breath can stain,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which malice must attack in vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With open heart and bounteous hand, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The nymph thus accomplished is feared by the men and hated by the women;
and Swift has shown his utter want of heart and good taste, by making
his homage to the woman he loved, a vehicle for the bitterest satire on
the rest of her sex. What right had he to accuse us of a universal
preference for mere coxcombs,&mdash;he who,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span> through the sole power of his
wit and intellect, had inspired with the most passionate attachment two
lovely women not half his own age? Be it remembered, that while Swift
was playing the Abelard with such effect, he was in his forty-fifth
year, and though</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">He moved and bowed, and talked with so much grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor showed the parson in his gait or face,<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>he was one of the ugliest men in existence,&mdash;of a bilious, saturnine
complexion, and a most forbidding countenance.</p>

<p>The poem of Cadenus and Vanessa was written immediately on his return to
Ireland and to Stella, (where he describes himself devoured by
melancholy and regret,) and sent to Vanessa. Her passion and her
inexperience seem to have blinded her to what was humiliating to herself
in this poem, and left her sensible only to the admiration it expressed,
and the hopes it conveyed. She wrote him the most impassioned letters;
and he replied in a style which, without committing himself, kept alive
all her tenderness, and rivetted his influence over her.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>
<p>Meanwhile, what became of Stella? Too quick-sighted not to perceive the
difference in Swift's manner, pining under his neglect, and struck to
the heart by jealousy, grief, and resentment, her health gave way. His
pitiful resolve never to see her alone, precluded all complaint or
explanation. The Mrs. Dingley who had been chosen for her companion, was
merely calculated to save appearances;&mdash;respectable, indeed, in point of
reputation, but selfish, narrow-minded and weak. Thus abandoned to
sullen, silent sorrow, the unhappy Stella fell into an alarming state;
and her destroyer was at length roused to some remorse, by the daily
spectacle of the miserable wreck he had caused. He commissioned his
friend Dr. Ashe, "to learn the secret cause of that dejection of spirits
which had so visibly preyed on her health; and to know whether it was by
any means in his power to remove it?" She replied, "that the peculiarity
of her circumstances, and her singular connexion with Swift for so many
years, had given great occasion for scandal; that she had learned to
bear this patiently, hoping that all such reports<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span> would be effaced by
marriage; but she now saw, with deep grief, that his behaviour was
totally changed, and that a cold indifference had succeeded to the
warmest professions of eternal affection. That the necessary
consequences would be, an indelible stain fixed on her character, and
the loss of her good name, which was dearer to her than life."<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>Swift answered, that in order to satisfy Mrs. Johnson's scruples, and
relieve her mind, he was ready to go through the mere ceremony of
marriage with her, on two conditions;&mdash;first, that they should live
separately exactly as they did before;&mdash;secondly, that it should be kept
a profound secret from all the world.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> To these conditions,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span> however
hard and humiliating, she was obliged to submit: and the ceremony was
performed privately by Dr. Ashe, in 1716. This nominal marriage spared
her at least some of the torments of jealousy, by rendering a union with
her rival impossible.</p>

<p>Yet, within a year afterwards, we find this ill-fated rival, the yet
more unhappy Vanessa,&mdash;more unhappy because endued by nature with
quicker passions, and far less fortitude and patience,&mdash;following Swift
to Ireland. She had a plausible pretext for this journey, being heiress
to a considerable property at Celbridge, about twelve miles from Dublin,
on which she came to reside with her sister;<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> but her real
inducement was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span> her unconquerable love for him. Nothing could be more
<i>mal apropos</i> to Swift than her arrival in Dublin: placed between two
women, thus devoted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span> to him, his perplexity was not greater than his
heartless duplicity deserved: nothing could extricate him but the
simple, but desperate expedient of disclosing the truth, and this he
could not or would not do: regardless of the sacred ties which now bound
him to Stella, he continued to correspond with Vanessa and to visit her;
but "the whole course of this correspondence precludes the idea of a
guilty intimacy."<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> <i>She</i>, whose passion was as pure as it was
violent and exclusive, asked but to be his wife. She would have flung
down her fortune and herself at his feet, and bathed them with tears of
gratitude, if he would have deigned to lift her to his arms. In the
midst of all the mortification, anguish, and heart-wearing suspense to
which his stern temper and inexplicable conduct exposed her, still she
clung to the hopes he had awakened, and which, either in cowardice, or
compassion, or selfish egotism, he still kept alive. He concludes one of
his letters with the following sentence in French,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span> "mais soyez assur&eacute;e,
que jamais personne au monde n'a &eacute;t&eacute; aim&eacute;e, honor&eacute;e, estim&eacute;e, ador&eacute;e,
par votre amie, que vous:"<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> and there are other passages to the same
effect, little agreeing with his professions to poor Stella:&mdash;one or the
other, or both, must have been grossly deceived.</p>

<p>After declarations so explicit, Vanessa naturally wondered that he
proceeded no farther; it appears that he sometimes endeavoured to
repress her over-flowing tenderness, by treating her with a harshness
which drove her almost to frenzy. There is really nothing in the
effusions of Helo&iuml;se or Mdlle. de l'Espinasse, that can exceed, in
pathos and burning eloquence, some of her letters to him during this
period of their connection.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> When he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span> had reduced her to the most
shocking and pitiable state, so that her life or her reason were

revived her hopes&mdash;</p>

<p>It will be said, where was her sex's delicacy, where her woman's pride?
Alas!&mdash;</p>

<p>In this agonizing suspense she lived through eight long years; till,
unable to endure it longer, and being aware of the existence of Stella,
she took the decisive step of writing to her rival, and desired to know
whether she was, or was not, married to Swift? Stella answered her
immediately in the affirmative; and then, justly indignant that he
should have given any other woman such a right in him as was implied by
the question, she enclosed Vanessa's letter to Swift; and instantly,
with a spirit she had never before exerted, quitted her lodgings,
withdrew to the house of Mr. Ford,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span> of Wood Park, and threw herself on
the friendship and protection of his family.</p>

<p>This lamentable tragedy was now brought to a crisis. Swift, on receiving
the letter, was seized with one of those insane paroxysms of rage to
which he was subject. He mounted his horse, rode down to Celbridge, and
suddenly entered the room in which Vanessa was sitting. His countenance,
fitted by nature to express the dark and fierce passions, so terrified
her, that she could scarce ask him whether he would sit down? He replied
savagely, "No!" and throwing down before her, her own letter to Stella,
with a look of inexpressible scorn and anger, flung out of the room, and
returned to Dublin.</p>

<p>This cruel scene was her death warrant.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> Hitherto she had venerated
Swift; and in the midst of her sufferings, confided in him, idolized him
as the first of human beings. What must he now have appeared in her
eyes?&mdash;They say, "Hell has no fury like a woman scorned;"&mdash;it is not
so:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span> the recoil of the heart, when forced to abhor and contemn, where it
has once loved, is far,&mdash;far worse; and Vanessa, who had endured her
lover's scorn, could not scorn <i>him</i>, and live. She was seized with a
delirious fever, and died "in resentment and in despair."<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> She
desired, in her last will, that the poem of Cadenus and Vanessa, which
she considered as a monument of Swift's love for her, should be
published, with some of his letters, which would have explained what was
left obscure, and have cleared her fame. The poem was published; but the
letters, by the interference of Swift's friends, were, at the time,
suppressed.</p>

<p>On her death, and Stella's flight, Swift absented himself from home for
two months, nor did any one know whither he was gone. During that time,
what must have been his feelings&mdash;<i>if</i> he felt at all? what agonies of
remorse, grief, shame, and horror, must have wrung his bosom! he had, in
effect, murdered the woman who loved him, as absolutely as if he had
plunged a poniard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span> into her heart: and yet it is not clear that Swift
was a prey to any such feelings; at least his subsequent conduct gave no
assurance of it. On his return to Dublin, mutual friends interfered to
reconcile him with Stella. About this time, she happened to meet, at a
dinner-party, a gentleman who was a stranger to the real circumstances
of her situation, and who began to speak of the poem of Cadenus and
Vanessa, then just published. He observed, that Vanessa must have been
an admirable creature to have inspired the Dean to write so finely.
"That does not follow," replied Mrs. Johnson, with bitterness; "it is
well known that the Dean could write finely on a <i>broomstick</i>." Ah! how
must jealousy and irritation, and long habits of intimacy with Swift,
have poisoned the mind and temper of this unhappy woman, before she
could have uttered this cruel sarcasm!&mdash;And yet she was true to the
softness of her sex; for after the lapse of several months, during which
it required all the attention of Mr. Ford and his family to sustain and
console her, she consented to return to Dublin,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span> and live with the Dean
on the same terms as before. Well does old Chaucer say,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">There can no man in humblesse him acquite<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As woman can, he can be half so true<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As woman be!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Swift welcomed her to town," says Sheridan, "with that beautiful poem
entitled 'Stella at Wood Park;'" that is to say, he welcomed back to the
home from which he had driven her, the woman whose heart he had well
nigh broken, the wife he had every way injured and abused,&mdash;with a
tissue of coarse sarcasms, on the taste for magnificence she must have
acquired in her visit to Wood Park, and the difficulty of descending</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">From every day a lordly banquet<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To half a joint&mdash;and God be thanket!<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Small beer, a herring, and the Dean.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And this was all the sentiment, all the poetry with which the occasion
inspired him!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>Stella naturally hoped, that when her rival was no more, and Swift no
longer exposed to her torturing reproaches, that he would do her tardy
justice, and at length acknowledge her as his wife. But no;&mdash;it would
have cost him some little mortification and inconvenience; and on such a
paltry pretext he suffered this amiable and admirable woman, of whom he
had said, that "her merits towards him were greater than ever was in any
human being towards another;" and "that she excelled in every good
quality that could possibly accomplish a human creature,"&mdash;this woman
did he suffer to languish into the grave, broken in heart and blighted
in name. When Stella was on her death-bed, some conversation passed
between them upon this sad subject. Only Swift's reply was audible: he
said, "Well, my dear, it shall be acknowledged, if you wish it." To
which she answered with a sigh, "It is <i>now</i> too late!"<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> It <i>was</i>
too late!&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">What now to her was womanhood or fame?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She died of a lingering decline, in January, 1728, four years after the
death of Miss Vanhomrigh.</p>

<p>Thus perished these two innocent, warm-hearted and accomplished
women;&mdash;so rich in all the graces of their sex&mdash;so formed to love and to
be loved, to bless, and to be blessed,&mdash;sacrifices to the demoniac pride
of the man they had loved and trusted. But it will be said, "si elles
n'avaient point aim&eacute;, elles seraient moins connues:" they have become
immortal by their connection with genius; they are celebrated, merely
through their attachment to a celebrated man. But, good God! what an
immortality! won by what martyrdom of the heart!&mdash;And what a celebrity!
not that with which the poet's love, and his diviner verse, crown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span> the
deified object of his homage, but a celebrity, purchased with their
life-blood and their tears! I quit the subject with a sense of
relief:&mdash;yet one word more.</p>

<p>It was after the death of these two amiable women, who had deserved so
much from him, and whose enduring tenderness had flung round his odious
life and character their only redeeming charm of sentiment and interest,
that the native grossness and rancour of this incarnate spirit of libel
burst forth with tenfold virulence.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> He showed how true had been his
love and his respect for <i>them</i>, by insulting and reviling, in terms a
scavenger would disavow, the sex they belonged to. Swift's
master-passion was pride,&mdash;an unconquerable, all-engrossing,
self-revolving pride: he was proud of his vigorous intellect, proud of
being the "dread and hate of half mankind,"&mdash;proud of his contempt for
women,&mdash;proud of his tremendous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span> powers of invective. It was his boast,
that he never forgave an injury; it was his boast, that the ferocious
and unsparing personal satire with which he avenged himself on those who
offended him, had never been softened by the repentance, or averted by
the concessions of the offender. Look at him in his last years, when the
cold earth was heaped over those who would have cheered and soothed his
dark and stormy spirit; without a friend&mdash;deprived of the mighty powers
he had abused&mdash;alternately a drivelling idiot and a furious maniac, and
sinking from both into a helpless, hopeless, prostrate lethargy of body
and mind!&mdash;Draw,&mdash;draw the curtain, in reverence to the human ruin, lest
our woman's hearts be tempted to unwomanly exultation!</p>

resided, is built much in the form of a real cloister, especially in its
external appearance. An aged man (upwards of ninety, by his own
account,) showed the grounds to my correspondent. He was the son of Mrs.
Vanhomrigh's gardener, and used to work with his father in the garden
when a boy. He remembered the unfortunate Vanessa well; and his account
of her corresponded with the usual description of her person, especially
as to her <i>embonpoint</i>. He said she went seldom abroad, and saw little
company; her constant amusement was reading, or walking in the garden.
Yet, according to this authority, her society was courted by several
families in the neighbourhood, who visited her, notwithstanding her
seldom returning that attention; and he added, that her manners
interested every one who knew her,&mdash;but she avoided company, and was
always melancholy save when Dean Swift was there, and then she seemed
happy. The garden was to an uncommon degree crowded with laurels. The
old man said, that when Miss Vanhomrigh expected the Dean, she always
planted with her own hand a laurel or two against his arrival. He showed
her favourite seat, still called Vanessa's Bower. Three or four trees,
and some laurels, indicate the spot. They had formerly, according to the
old man's information, been trained into a close arbour. There were two
seats and a rude table within the bower, the opening of which commanded
a view of the Liffey, which had a romantic effect; and there was a small
cascade that murmured at some distance. In this sequestered spot,
according to the old gardener's account, the Dean and Vanessa used often
to sit, with books and writing materials on the table before
them."&mdash;<i>Scott's Life of Swift.</i></p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<h3>POPE AND MARTHA BLOUNT.</h3>


<p>If the soul of sensibility, which I believe Pope really possessed, had
been enclosed in a healthful frame and an agreeable person, we might
have reckoned him among our <i>preux chevaliers</i>, and have had sonnets
instead of satires. But he seems to have been ever divided between two
contending feelings. He was peculiarly sensible to the charms of women,
and his habits as a valetudinarian, rendered their society and attention
not only soothing and delightful, but absolutely necessary to him:
while, unhappily, there mingled with this real love for them, and
dependance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span> on them as a sex, the most irascible self-love; and a
torturing consciousness of that feebleness and deformity of person,
which embittered all his intercourse with them. He felt that, in his
character of poet, he could, by his homage, flatter their vanity, and
excite their admiration and their fear; but, at the same time, he was
shivering under the apprehension that, as a man, they regarded him with
contempt; and that he could never hope to awaken in a female bosom any
feelings corresponding with his own. So far he was unjust to us and to
himself: his friend Lord Lyttelton, and his enemy Lord Hervey,<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>
might have taught him better.</p>

<p>On reviewing Pope's life, his works, and his correspondence, it seems to
me that these two opposite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span> feelings contending in his bosom from youth
to age, will account for the general character of his poems with a
reference to our sex:&mdash;will explain why women bear so prominent a part
in all his works, whether as objects of poetical gallantry, honest
admiration, or poignant satire: why there is not among all his
productions more than one poem decidedly amatory, (and that one partly
suppressed in the ordinary editions of his works,) while women only have
furnished him with the materials of all his <i>chef-d'&oelig;uvres</i>: his
Elegy, his 'Rape of the Lock,' the 'Epistle of Helo&iuml;se,' and the second
of his Moral Essays. He may call us, and prove us, in his antithetical
style, "a contradiction:"<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> but we may retort; for, as far as women
are concerned, Pope was himself one miserable antithesis.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The "Elegy to the memory of an unfortunate Lady," refers to a tragedy
which occurred in Pope's early life, and over which he has studiously<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
drawn an impenetrable veil. When his friend Mr. Caryl wrote to him on
the subject, many years after the Elegy was published, Pope, in his
reply, left this part of the letter unnoticed; and a second application
was equally unsuccessful. His biographers are not better informed.
Johnson remarks upon the Elegy, that it commemorates the "amorous fury
of a raving girl, who liked self-murder better than suspense;" and
having given this deadly stroke with his critical fang, the grim old
lion of literature stalks on, and "stays no farther question." But is
this merciful, or is it just? by what right does he sit in judgment on
the unhappy dead, of whom he knew nothing? or how could he tell by what
course of suffering, disease, or tyranny, a gentle spirit may have been
goaded to frenzy? It was said, on the authority of some French author,
that she was secretly attached to one of the French princes: that, in
consequence, her uncle and guardian ("the mean deserter of a brother's
blood,") forced her into a convent, where, in despair and madness, she
put an end to her existence; and that the lines<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Why bade ye else, ye powers! her soul aspire<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Above the vulgar flight of low desire?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ambition first sprung from your blest abodes;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The glorious fault of angels and of gods,&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>refer to this ambitious passion. But then, again, this has been
contradicted. Warton's story is improbable and inconsistent with the
poem;<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> and the assertion of another author,<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> that she was in
love with Pope, and as deformed as himself, is most unlikely. "O ever
beauteous, ever friendly!" is rather a strange style of apostrophising
one deformed in person; and exposed to misery, and driven to suicide, by
a passion for himself. In short, it is all mystery, wonder, and
conjecture.</p>

<p>Other women who have been loved, celebrated, or satirized by Pope, are
at least more notorious, if not so interesting. His most lasting and
real attachment, was that which he entertained for Theresa and Martha
Blount, who alternately, or with divided empire, reigned in his heart or
fancy for five-and-thirty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span> years. They were of an old Roman Catholic
family of Oxfordshire; and his acquaintance with them appears to have
begun as early as 1707, when he was only nineteen. Theresa, the
handsomest and most intelligent of the two sisters, was a brunette, with
black sparkling eyes. Martha was short in stature, fair, with blue eyes,
and a softer expression. They appear to have been tolerably amiable, and
much attached to each other: <i>au reste</i>, in no way distinguished, but by
the flattering admiration of a celebrated man, who has immortalised
both.</p>

<p>The verses addressed to them, convey in general, either counsel or
compliment, or at the most playful gallantry. His letters express
something beyond these. He began by admiring Theresa; then he wavered:
there were misunderstandings, and petulance, and mutual bickerings. His
susceptibility exposed him to be continually wounded; he felt deeply and
acutely; he was conscious that he could inspire no sentiment
corresponding with that which throbbed at his own heart: and some
passages in the correspondence cannot be read without a painful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span> pity.
At length, upon some mutual offence, his partiality for Theresa was
transferred to Martha. In one of his last letters to Theresa, he says,
beautifully and feelingly, "We are too apt to resent things too highly,
till we come to know, by some great misfortune or other, how much we are
born to endure; and as for me, you need not suspect of resentment a soul
which can feel nothing but grief."</p>

<p>His attachment to Martha increased after his quarrel with Lady Mary W.
Montagu, and ended only with his life.</p>

<p>"He was never," says Mr. Bowles, "indifferent to female society; and
though his good sense prevented him, conscious of so many personal
infirmities, from marrying, yet he felt the want of that sort of
reciprocal tenderness and confidence in a female, to whom he might
freely communicate his thoughts, and on whom, in sickness and infirmity,
he could rely. All this Martha Blount became to him; by degrees, she
became identified with his existence. She partook of his
disappointments, his vexations, and his comforts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span> Wherever he went, his
correspondence with her was never remitted; and when the warmth of
gallantry was over, the cherished idea of kindness and regard
remained."<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>Very excellent advice, and very disinterested, considering whence it
came, and to whom it was addressed!!</p>

<p>The poem generally placed after this in his works, and entitled "Epistle
to the <i>same</i> Lady, on leaving town after the Coronation," was certainly
not addressed to Martha, but to Theresa. It appears from the
correspondence, that Martha was not at the Coronation in 1715, and that
Theresa was. The whole tenour of this poem is agreeable to the sprightly
person and character of Theresa, while "Parthenia's softer blush,"
evidently alludes to Martha. From an examination of the letters which
were written at this time, I should imagine, that though Pope had
previously assured the latter that she had gained the conquest over her
fair sister, yet the public appearance of Theresa at the Coronation, and
her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span> superior charms, revived all his tenderness and admiration, and
suggested this gay and pleasing effusion.</p>

<span class="i2">And leave you in lone woods or empty walls!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To Martha Blount is dedicated the "Epistle on the Characters of Women;"
which concludes with this elegant and flattering address to her.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">O! blest with temper, whose unclouded ray<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>The allusion to her affection for her sister, is just and beautiful; but
the compliment to her temper is understood not to have been quite
merited&mdash;perhaps, was rather administered as a corrective; for Martha
was weak and captious; and Pope, who had suffered what torments a female
wit could inflict, possibly found that peevishness and folly have also
their <i>d&eacute;sagr&eacute;mens</i>. He complains frequently, in his letters to Martha,
of the difficulty of pleasing her, or understanding her wishes.
Methinks, had I been a poet, or Pope, I would rather have been led about
in triumph by the spirited, accomplished Lady Mary, than "chained to the
footstool of two paltry girls."</p>

<p>They used to employ him constantly in the most trifling and troublesome
commissions, in which he had seldom even the satisfaction of contenting
them. He was accustomed to send<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span> them little presents almost daily, as
concert-tickets, ribbons, fruit, &amp;c. He once sent them a basket of
peaches, which, with an affectation of careless gallantry, were
separately wrapped in part of the manuscript translation of the Iliad:
and he humbly requests them to return the wrappers, as he had no other
copy. On another occasion he sent them fans, on which were inscribed his
famous lines,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Come, gentle air," th' Eolian shepherd said, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Martha Blount was not so kind or so attentive to Pope in his last
illness as she ought to have been. His love for <i>her</i> seemed blended
with his frail existence; and when he was scarcely sensible to any thing
else in the world, he was still conscious of the charm of her presence.
"When she came into the room," says Spence, "it was enough to give a new
turn to his spirits, and a temporary strength to him."</p>

<p>She survived him eighteen years, and died unmarried at her house in
Berkeley Square, in 1762. She is described, about that time, as a
little, fair,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span> prim old woman, very lively, and inclined to gossip. Her
undefined connexion with Pope, though it afforded matter for mirth and
wonder, never affected her reputation while living; and has rendered her
name as immortal as our language and our literature. One cannot help
wishing that she had been more interesting, and more worthy of her
fame.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<h3>POPE AND LADY M. W. MONTAGU.</h3>


<p>In the same year with Martha Blount, and about the same age, died Lady
Mary W. Montagu. Every body knows that she was one of Pope's early
loves. She had, for several years, suspended his attachment to his first
favourites, the Blounts; and she really deserved the preference. But the
issue of this romantic attachment was the most bitter, the most
irreconcilable enmity. The cause did not proceed so much from any one
particular offence on either side, but rather from a multitude of
trifling causes, arising naturally out of the characters of both.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p>When they first met, Pope was about six-and-twenty; and from the recent
publication of the 'Rape of the Lock,' and 'The Temple of Fame,' &amp;c. had
reached the pinnacle of fashion and reputation. Lady Mary was in her
twenty-third year, lately married to a man she loved, and had just burst
upon the world in all the blaze of her wit and beauty. Her masculine
acquirements and powers of mind&mdash;her strong good sense&mdash;her extensive
views&mdash;her frankness, decision, and generosity&mdash;her vivacity, and her
bright eyes, must altogether have rendered her one of the most
fascinating, as she really was one of the most extraordinary, women that
ever lived.</p>

<p>There stands, in a conspicuous part of this great city, a certain
monument, erected, it is said, at the cost of the ladies of Britain; but
in a spirit and taste which, I trust, are not those of my countrywomen
at large. Is this our patriotism? We may applaud the brave, who go forth
to battle to defend us, and preserve inviolate the sanctity of our
hearths and homes; but does it become us to lend our voice to exult in
victory, always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span> bought at the expense of suffering, and aggravate the
din and the clamour of war&mdash;we, who ought to be the peace-makers of the
world, and plead for man against his own fierce passions? A huge brazen
image stands up, an impudent (false) witness of our martial enthusiasm;
but who amongst us has thought of raising a public statue to Lady
Wortley Montagu! to her who has almost banished from the world that pest
which once extinguished families and desolated provinces? To her true
patriotic spirit,&mdash;to her magnanimity, her generous perseverance, in
surmounting all obstacles raised by the outcry of ignorance, and the
obstinacy of prejudice, we owe the introduction of inoculation;&mdash;she
ought to stand in marble beside Howard the good.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>
<p>I should imagine that a strong impression must have been made on Lady
Mary's mind, by an incident which occurred just at the time she left
England for Constantinople. Lord Petre,&mdash;he who is consecrated to fame
in the Rape of the Lock, as the ravisher of Arabella Fermour's
hair,&mdash;died of the small-pox at the age of three-and-twenty, just after
his marriage with a young and beautiful heiress; his death caused a
general sympathy, and added to the dread and horror which was inspired
by this terrible disease: eighteen persons of his family had died of it
within twenty-seven years. In those days it was not even allowable to
mention, or allude to it in company.</p>

<p>Mr. Wortley was appointed to the Turkish embassy in 1716, and his wife
accompanied him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span> The letters which passed between her and Pope, during
her absence, are well known. In point of style and liveliness, the
superiority is on the lady's side; but the tone of feeling in Pope is
better, more earnest; his language is not always within the bounds of
that sprightly gallantry with which a man naturally addresses a young,
beautiful, and virtuous woman, who had condescended to allow his
homage.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>In one of his letters, written immediately after her departure, he asks
her how he had looked? how he had behaved at the last moment? whether he
had betrayed any deeper feeling than propriety might warrant? "For if,"
he says, "my parting looked like that of a common acquaintance, I am the
greatest of all hypocrites that ever decency made." And in a subsequent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
letter he says, very feelingly and significantly, "May that person (her
husband) for whom you have left the world, be so just as to prefer you
to all the world. I believe his good sense leads him to do so now, as
gratitude will hereafter. May you continue to think him worthy of
whatever you have done! may you ever look upon him with the eyes of a
first lover, nay, if possible, with all the unreasonable happy fondness
of an unexperienced one, surrounded with all the enchantments and ideas
of romance and poetry! I wish this from my heart; and while I examine
what passes there in regard to you, I cannot but glory in my own heart,
that it is capable of so much generosity."</p>

<p>This was sufficiently clear. I need scarcely remark <i>en passant</i>, that
Pope's generosity and wishes were all <i>en pure perte</i>; his spitefulness
must have been gratified by the sequel of Lady Mary's domestic bliss;
her marriage ended in disgust and aversion; which, on her separation
from Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span> Wortley, subsided into a good-humoured indifference.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>After a union of twenty-seven years, she parted from him and went to
reside abroad. There were errors on both sides; but I am obliged to
admit that Lady Mary, with all her fine qualities, had two
faults,&mdash;intolerable and unpardonable faults in the eyes of a husband or
a lover. She wanted softness of mind, and refinement of feeling, in the
first place: and she wanted&mdash;how shall I express it?&mdash;she wanted
neatness and personal delicacy; and was, in short, that <i>odious</i> thing,
a female sloven, as well as that <i>dangerous</i> thing, a female wit.</p>

<p>In those days the style of dress was the most hideous imaginable. The
women wore a large quantity of artificial hair, in emulation of the
tremendous periwigs of the men; and Pope, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span> one of his letters to Lady
Mary, mentions her "full bottomed wig," which, he says, "I did but
assert to be a <i>bob</i>" and was answered, "Love is blind!" On her return
from Turkey, she sometimes allowed her own fine dark hair to flow loose,
and was fond of dressing in her Turkish costume. In this she was
imitated by several beautiful women of the day, and particularly by her
lovely contemporary, Lady Fanny Shirley, (Chesterfield's "Fanny,
blooming fair:" he seems to have admired her as much as he could
possibly admire any thing, next to himself and the Graces.) In her
picture at Clarendon Park, she too appears in the habit of Fatima.
<i>Apropos</i>, to the loves of the poets, Lady Fanny deserves to be
mentioned as the theme of all the rhymesters, and "the joy, the wish,
the wonder, the despair," of all the beaux of her day.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>
<p>But it is time to return to Pope. The epistle of Helo&iuml;se to Abelard was
published during Lady Mary's absence, and sent to her: and it is clear
from a passage in one of his letters, that he wished her to consider the
last lines,&mdash;from</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And sure, if fate some future bard shall join,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>down to</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">He best can paint them, who can feel them most,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>as applicable to himself and to his feelings towards her.</p>

<p>And yet, whatever might have been his devotion to Lady Mary before she
went abroad, it was increased tenfold after her memorable travels. At
present, when ladies of fashion make excursions of pleasure to the
pyramids of Egypt and the ruins of Babylon, a journey to Constantinople
is little more than a trip to Rome or Vienna; but in the last age it was
a prodigious and marvellous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span> undertaking; and Lady Mary, on her return,
was gazed upon as an object of wonder and curiosity, and sought as the
most entertaining person in the world: her sprightliness and her beauty,
her oriental stories and her Turkish costume, were the rage of the day.
With Pope, she was on the most friendly terms:&mdash;by his interference and
negociation, a house was procured for her and Mr. Wortley, at
Twickenham, so that their intercourse was almost constant. When he
finished his translation of the Iliad, in 1720, Gay wrote him a
complimentary poem, in which he enumerates the host of friends who
welcomed the poet home from Greece; and among them, Lady Mary stands
conspicuous.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">What lady's that to whom he gently bends?<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Who knows not her! Ah, those are Wortley's eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How art thou honoured, numbered with her friends,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">For she distinguishes the good and wise!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To this period we may also refer the composition of the Stanzas to Lady
Mary, which begin, "In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span> beauty and wit."<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> The measure is trivial and
disagreeable, but the compliments are very sprightly and pointed.</p>

<p>She sat to Kneller for him in her Turkish dress; and we have the
following note from him on the subject, which shows how much he felt the
condescension.</p>

<p>"The picture dwells really at my heart, and I have made a perfect
passion of preferring your present face to your past. I know and
thoroughly esteem yourself of this year. I know no more of Lady Mary
Pierrepoint than to admire at what I have heard of her, or be pleased
with some fragments of hers, as I am with Sappho's. But now&mdash;I cannot
say what I would say of you now. Only still give me cause to say you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
are good to me, and allow me as much of your person as Sir Godfrey can
help me to. Upon conferring with him yesterday, I find he thinks it
absolutely necessary to draw your face first, which, he says, can never
be set right on your figure, if the drapery and posture be finished
before. To give you as little trouble as possible, he purposes to draw
your face with crayons, and finish it up at your own house of a morning;
from whence he will transfer it to canvass, so that you need not go to
sit at his house. This, I must observe, is a manner they seldom draw any
but crowned heads, and I observe it with a secret pride and pleasure. Be
so kind as to tell me if you care, he should do this to-morrow at
twelve. Though, if I am but assured from you of the thing, let the
manner and time be what you best like; let every decorum you please be
observed. I should be very unworthy of any favour from your hands, if I
desired any at the expense of your quiet or conveniency in any degree."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p>He was charmed with the picture, and composed an extemporary compliment,
beginning</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">The playful smiles around the dimpled mouth,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That happy air of majesty and truth; &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>which, considering that they are Pope's, are strangely defective in
rhyme, in sense, and in grammar. In a far different strain are the
beautiful lines addressed to Gay, during Lady Mary's absence from
Twickenham, and which he afterwards endeavoured to suppress. They are
curious on this account, as well as for being the solitary example of
amatory verse contained in his works.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Ah friend! 'tis true,&mdash;this truth you lovers know,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In vain my structures rise, my gardens grow;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In vain fair Thames reflects the double scenes,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of hanging mountains, and of sloping greens;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Joy lives not here, to happier seats it flies,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And only dwells where Wortley casts her eyes.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">What are the gay parterre, the chequer'd shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The morning bower, the evening colonnade,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">But soft recesses of uneasy minds,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To sigh unheard in to the passing winds?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So the struck deer, in some sequester'd part,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">There, stretch'd unseen in coverts hid from day,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Bleeds drop by drop, and pants his life away.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These sweet and musical lines, which fall on the ear with such a lulling
harmony, are dashed with discord when we remember that the same woman
who inspired them, was afterwards malignantly and coarsely designated as
the Sappho of his satires. The generous heart never coolly degraded and
insulted what it has once loved; but Pope <i>could</i> not be
magnanimous,&mdash;it was not in his spiteful nature to forgive. He says of
himself,</p>

<p>One of Pope's biographers<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> seems to insinuate, that he had been led
on, by the lady's coquetry, to presume too far, and in consequence
received a repulse, which he never forgave. This is not probable: Pope
was not likely to be so desperate or dangerous an admirer; nor was Lady
Mary, who had written with her diamond ring on a window,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Let this great maxim be my virtue's guide:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In part, she is to blame that has been tried,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He comes too near, that comes to be denied!&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>at all likely to expose herself to such ridiculous audacity. The truth
is, I rather imagine, that there was a great deal of vanity on both
sides; that the lady was amused and flattered, and the poet bewitched
and in earnest: that <i>she</i> gave the first offence by some pointed
sarcasm or personal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span> ridicule, in which she was an adept, and that Pope,
gradually awakened from his dream of adoration, was stung to the quick
by her laughing scorn, and mortified and irritated by the consciousness
of his wasted attachment. He makes this confession with extreme
bitterness,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Yet soft by nature, more a dupe than wit,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sappho can tell you how this man was bit.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i11"><i>Prologue to the Satires.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The lines as they stand in a first edition are even more pointed and
significant, and have much more asperity.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Once, and but once, his heedless youth was bit,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And liked that dangerous thing, a female wit.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Safe as he thought, though all the prudent chid,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He wrote no libels, but <i>my lady</i> did;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Great odds in amorous or poetic game,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where woman's is the <i>sin</i>, and man's the <i>shame</i>!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The result was a deadly and interminable feud. Lady Mary might possibly
have inflicted the first private offence, but Pope gave the first public
affront. A man who, under such circumstances,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span> could grossly satirize a
female, would, in a less civilized state of society, have revenged
himself with a blow. The brutality and cowardice were the same.</p>

<p>The war of words did not, however, proceed at once to such extremity;
the first indication of Pope's revolt from his sworn allegiance, and a
conscious hint of the secret cause, may be found in some lines addressed
to a lady poetess,<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> to whom he pays a compliment at Lady Mary's
expense.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Though sprightly Sappho force our love and praise,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A softer wonder my pleased soul surveys,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The mild Erinna blushing in her bays;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So while the sun's broad beam yet strikes the sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All mild appears the moon's more sober light.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Serene in virgin majesty she shines,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And unobserved, the glaring orb declines.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Soon after appeared that ribald and ruffian-like attack on her in the
satires. She sent Lord Peterborough to remonstrate with Pope, to whom he
denied the intended application; and his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span> disavowal is a proved
falsehood. Lady Mary, exasperated, forgot her good sense and her
feminine dignity, and made common cause with Lord Hervey (the Lord Fanny
and the Sporus of the Satires.) They concocted an attack in verse,
addressed to the imitator of Horace; but nothing could be more unequal
than such a warfare. Pope, in return, grasped the blasting and vollied
lightnings of his wit, and would have annihilated both his adversaries,
if more than half a grain of truth had been on his side. But posterity
has been just: in his anger, he overcharged his weapon, it recoiled, and
the engineer has been "hoisted by his own petard."</p>

<p>Lady Mary's personal negligence afforded grounds for Pope's coarse and
severe allusions to the "colour of her linen, &amp;c." His asperity,
however, did not reform her in this respect: it was a fault which
increased with age and foreign habits. Horace Walpole, who met her at
Florence twenty years afterwards, draws a hateful and disgusting picture
of her, as "old, dirty, tawdry, painted," and flirting and gambling with
all the young men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span> in the place. But Walpole is terribly satirical; he
had a personal dislike to Lady Mary Wortley, whom he coarsely designates
as <i>Moll Worthless</i>,&mdash;and his description is certainly overcharged. How
differently the same characters will strike different people! Spence,
who also met Lady Mary abroad, about that time, thus writes to his
mother: "I always desired to be acquainted with Lady Mary, and could
never bring it about, though we were so often together in London. Soon
after we came to this place, her ladyship came here, and in five days I
was well acquainted with her. She is one of the most shining characters
in the world,&mdash;but shines like a comet: she is all irregularity, and
always wandering: the most wise, most imprudent, loveliest, most
disagreeable, best-natured, cruellest woman in the world!" Walpole could
see nothing but her dirt and her paint. Those who recollect his coarse
description, and do <i>not</i> remember her letters to her daughter, written
from Italy about the same time, would do well to refer to them as a
corrective: it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span> always so easy to be satirical and ill-natured, and
sometimes so difficult to be just and merciful!</p>

<p>The cold scornful levity with which she treated certain topics, is
mingled with touches of tenderness and profound thought, which show her
to have been a disappointed, not a heartless woman. The extreme care
with which she cultivated pleasurable feelings and ideas, and shrunk
from all disagreeable impressions; her determination never to view her
own face in a glass, after the approach of age, or to pronounce the name
of her mad, profligate son, may be referred to a cause very different
from either selfishness or vanity: but I think the principle was
mistaken. While she was amusing herself with her silk-worms and her
orangerie at Como, her husband Wortley, with whom she kept up a constant
correspondence, was hoarding money and drinking tokay to keep himself
alive. He died, however, in 1761; and that he was connected with the
motives, whatever those were, which induced Lady Mary to reside abroad,
is proved by the fact, that the moment she heard of his death she
prepared to return to England, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span> she reached London in January 1762.
"Lady Mary is arrived," says Walpole, writing to George Montagu. "I have
seen her. I think her avarice, her dirt, and her vivacity, are all
increased. Her dress, like her language, is a galimatias of several
countries. She needs no cap, no handkerchief, no gown, no petticoat, no
shoes; an old black-laced hood represents the first; the fur of a
horseman's coat, which replaces the third, serves for the second; a
dimity petticoat is deputy, and officiates for the fourth; and slippers
act the part of the last." About six months after her arrival she died
in the arms of her daughter, the Countess of Bute, of a cruel and
shocking disease, the agonies of which she had borne with heroism rather
than resignation. The present Marquess of Bute, and the present Lord
Wharncliffe, are the great-grandsons of this distinguished woman: the
latter is the representative of the Wortley family.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<h3>POETICAL OLD BACHELORS.</h3>


<p>There is a certain class of poets, not a very numerous one, whom I would
call poetical old bachelors. They are such as enjoy a certain degree of
fame and popularity themselves, without sharing their celebrity with any
fair piece of excellence; but walk each on his solitary path to glory,
wearing their lonely honours with more dignity than grace: for instance,
Corneille, Racine, Boileau, the classical names of French poetry, were
all poetical old bachelors. Racine&mdash;<i>le tendre Racine</i>&mdash;as he is called
<i>par excellence</i>, is said never to have been in love in his life; nor
has he left us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span> a single verse in which any of his personal feelings can
be traced. He was, however, the kind and faithful husband of a cold,
bigoted woman, who was persuaded, and at length persuaded <i>him</i>, that he
would be <i>grill&eacute;</i> in the other world, for writing heathen tragedies in
this; and made it her boast that she had never read a single line of her
husband's works! Peace be with her!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And O, let her by whom the muse was scorn'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Alive nor dead, be of the muse adorn'd!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Our own Gray was in every sense, real and poetical, a cold fastidious
old bachelor, who buried himself in the recesses of his college; at once
shy and proud, sensitive and selfish. I cannot, on looking through his
memoirs, letters, and poems, discover the slightest trace of passion, or
one proof or even indication that he was ever under the influence of
woman. He loved his mother, and was dutiful to two tiresome old aunts,
who thought poetry one of the seven deadly sins&mdash;<i>et voil&agrave; tout</i>. He
spent his life in amassing an inconceivable quantity of knowledge,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
which lay as buried and useless as a miser's treasure; but with this
difference, that when the miser dies, his wealth flows forth into its
natural channels, and enriches others; Gray's learning was entombed with
him: his genius survives in his elegy and his odes;&mdash;what became of his
heart I know not. He is generally supposed to have possessed one, though
none can guess what he did with it:&mdash;he might well moralise on his
bachelorship, and call himself "a solitary fly,"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Thy joys no glittering female meets,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No hive hast thou of hoarded sweets,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No painted plumage to display!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Collins was never a lover, and never married. His odes, with all their
exquisite fancy and splendid imagery, have not much interest in their
subjects, and no pathos derived from feeling or passion. He is reported
to have been once in love; and as the lady was a day older than himself,
he used to say jestingly, that "he came into the world <i>a day after the
fair</i>." He was not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span> deeply smitten; and though he led in his early years
a dissipated life, his heart never seems to have been really touched. He
wrote an Ode on the Passions, in which, after dwelling on Hope, Fear,
Anger, Despair, Pity, and describing them with many picturesque
circumstances, he dismisses Love with a couple of lines, as dancing to
the sound of the sprightly viol, and forming with joy the light
fantastic round. Such was Collins's idea of love!</p>

<p>To these we may add Goldsmith. Of his loves we know nothing; they were
probably the reverse of poetical, and may have had some influence on his
purse and respectability, but none on his literary character and
productions. He also died unmarried.</p>

<p>Shenstone, if he was not a poetical old bachelor, was little better than
a poetical dangler. He was not formed to captivate: his person was
clumsy, his manners disagreeable, and his temper feeble and vacillating.
The Delia who is introduced into his elegies, and the Phillis of his
pastoral<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span> ballad, was Charlotte Graves, sister to the Graves who wrote
the Spiritual Quixotte. There was nothing warm or earnest in his
admiration, and all his gallantry is as vapid as his character. He never
gave the lady who was supposed, and supposed herself, to be the object
of his serious pursuit, an opportunity of accepting or rejecting him;
and his conduct has been blamed as ambiguous and unmanly. His querulous
declamations against women in general, had neither cause nor excuse; and
his complaints of infidelity and coldness are equally without
foundation. He died unmarried.</p>

<p>When we look at a picture of Thomson, we wonder how a man with that
heavy, pampered countenance, and awkward mien, could ever have written
the "Seasons," or have been in love. I think it is Barry Cornwall, who
says strikingly, that Thomson's figure "was a personification of the
Castle of Indolence, without its romance." Yet Thomson, though he has
not given any popularity or interest to the name of a woman, is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span> said to
have been twice in love, after his own <i>lack-a-daisical</i> fashion. He was
first attached to Miss Stanley, who died young, and upon whom he wrote
the little elegy,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Tell me, thou soul of her I love! &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He alludes to her also in Summer, in the passage beginning,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And art thou, Stanley, of the sacred band, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>His second love was long, quiet, and constant; but whether the lady's
coldness, or want of fortune, prevented a union, is not clear: probably
the latter. The object of this attachment was a Miss Young, who resided
at Richmond; and his attentions to her were continued through a long
series of years, and even till within a short time before his death, in
his forty-eighth year. She was his Amanda; and if she at all answered
the description of her in his Spring, she must have been a lovely and
amiable woman.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And thou, Amanda, come, pride of my song!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Form'd by the Graces, loveliness itself!<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Come with those downcast eyes, sedate and sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Those looks demure, that deeply pierce the soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where, with the light of thoughtful reason mix'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Shines lively fancy and the feeling heart:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oh, come! and while the rosy-footed May<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Steals blushing on, together let us tread<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The morning dews, and gather in their prime<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fresh-blooming flowers, to grace thy braided hair.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And if his attachment to her suggested that beautiful description of
domestic happiness with which his Spring concludes,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">But happy they, the happiest of their kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whom gentler stars unite, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>who would not grieve at the destiny which denied to Thomson pleasures he
could so eloquently describe, and so feelingly appreciate?</p>

<p>Truth, however, obliges me to add one little trait. A lady who did not
know Thomson personally, but was enchanted with his "Seasons," said she
could gather from his works three parts of his character,&mdash;that he was
an amiable lover, an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span> excellent swimmer, and extremely abstemious.
Savage, who knew the poet, could not help laughing at this picture of a
man who scarcely knew what love was; who shrunk from cold water like a
cat; and whose habits were those of a good-natured bon vivant, who
indulged himself in every possible luxury, which could be attained
without trouble! He also died unmarried.</p>

<p>Hammond, the favourite of our sentimental great-grandmothers, whose
"Love Elegies" lay on the toilettes of the Harriet Byrons and Sophia
Westerns of the last century, was an amiable youth, "very melancholy and
gentlemanlike," who being appointed equerry to Prince Frederic, cast his
eyes on Miss Dashwood, bed-chamber woman to the Princess, and she became
his Delia. The lady was deaf to his pastoral strains; and though it has
been said that she rejected him on account of the smallness of his
fortune, I do not see the necessity of believing this assertion, or of
sympathising in the dull invectives and monotonous lamentations of the
slighted lover. Miss Dashwood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span> never married, and was, I believe, one of
the maids of honour to the late Queen.</p>

<p>Thus the six poets, who, in the history of our literature, fill up the
period which intervened between the death of Pope and the first
publications of Burns and Cowper&mdash;all died old bachelors!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<h3>FRENCH POETS.</h3>

<h3>VOLTAIRE AND MADAME DU CHATELET.</h3>


<p>If we take a rapid view of French literature, from the reign of Louis
the Fourteenth, down to the Revolution, we are dazzled by the record of
brilliant and celebrated women, who protected or cultivated letters, and
obtained the homage of men of talent. There was Ninon; and there was
Madame de Rambouillet; the one <i>galante</i>, the other <i>precieuse</i>. One had
her St. Evremond; the other her Voiture. Madame de Sabli&egrave;re protected La
Fontaine; Madame de Montespan protected Moli&egrave;re; Madame de Maintenon
protected Racine. It was all patronage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span> and protection on one side, and
dependance and servility on the other. Then we have the <i>intrigante</i>
Madame de Tencin;<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> the good-natured, but rather <i>born&eacute;e</i> Madame de
G&eacute;offrin; the Duchesse de Maine, who held a little court of <i>bel
esprits</i> and small poets at S&ccedil;eaux, and is best known as the patroness
of Mademoiselle de Launay. Madame d'Epinay, the <i>amie</i> of Grimm, and the
patroness of Rousseau; the clever, selfish, witty, ever <i>ennuy&eacute;e</i>, never
<i>ennuyeuse</i> Madame du Deffand; the ardent, talented Mademoiselle de
l'Espinasse, who would certainly have been a poetess, if she had not
been a philosopheress and a Frenchwoman: Madame Neckar, the patroness of
Marmontel and Thomas:&mdash;<i>e tutte quante</i>. If we look over the light
French literature of those times, we find an inconceivable heap of <i>vers
galans</i>, and <i>jolis couplets</i>, licentious songs, pretty, well-turned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
compliments, and most graceful badinage; but we can discover the names
of only two distinguished women, who have the slightest pretensions to a
poetical celebrity, derived from the genius, the attachment, and the
fame of their lovers. These were Madame du Ch&acirc;telet, Voltaire's
"Immortelle Emilie:" and Madame d'Houdetot, the Doris of Saint-Lambert.</p>

<p>Gabrielle-Emilie le Tonnelier de Br&eacute;teuil, was the daughter of the Baron
de Br&eacute;teuil, and born in 1706. At an early age she was taken from her
convent, and married to the Marquis du Ch&acirc;telet; and her life seems
thenceforward to have been divided between two passions, or rather two
pursuits rarely combined,&mdash;love, and geometry. Her tutor in both is said
to have been the famous mathematician Clairaut; and between them they
rendered geometry so much the fashion at one time, that all the women,
who were distinguished either for rank or beauty, thought it
indispensable to have a geometrician in their train. The "Po&euml;tes de
Soci&eacute;t&eacute;" hid for a while their diminished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span> heads, or were obliged to
study geometry <i>pour se mettre &agrave; la mode</i>.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> Her friendship with
Voltaire began to take a serious aspect, when she was about
eight-and-twenty, and he was about forty; he is said to have succeeded
that <i>rou&eacute; par excellence</i>, the Duc de Richelieu, in her favour.</p>

<p>This woman might have dealt in mathematics,&mdash;might have inked her
fingers with writing treatises on the Newtonian philosophy; she might
have sat up till five in the morning, solving problems and calculating
eclipses;&mdash;and yet have possessed amiable, elevated, generous, and
attractive qualities, which would have thrown a poetical interest round
her character; moreover, considering the horribly corrupt state of
French society at that time, she might have been pardoned "une vertu de
moins," if her power over a great genius had been exercised to some good
purpose;&mdash;to restrain his licentiousness, to soften his pungent and
merciless satire, and prevent the frequent prostitution<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span> of his
admirable and versatile talents. But a female sceptic, profligate from
temperament and principle; a termagant, "qui voulait furieusement tout
ce qu'elle voulait; "a woman with all the <i>suffisance</i> of a pedant, and
all the <i>exigeance</i>, caprices, and frivolity of a fine lady,&mdash;<i>grands
dieux!</i> what a heroine for poetry!</p>

<p>To a taste for Newton and the stars, and geometry and algebra, Madame du

<p>This "Minerve de la France, la respectable Emilie," did not resemble
Minerva in <i>all</i> her attributes; nor was she satisfied with a
<i>succession</i> of lovers. The whole history of her <i>liaison</i> with
Voltaire, is enough to put <i>en d&eacute;route</i> all poetry, and all sentiment.
With her imperious temper and bitter tongue, and his extreme
irritability, no wonder they should have <i>des sc&ecirc;nes terribles</i>.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
Marmontel says they were often <i>&agrave; couteaux tir&eacute;s</i>; and this, not
metaphorically but literally. On one occasion, Voltaire happened to
criticise some couplets she had written for Madame de Luxembourg.
"L'Amante de Newton"<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> could calculate eclipses, but she could not
make verses; and, probably, for that reason, she was most particularly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
jealous of all censure, while she criticised Voltaire without manners or
mercy; and he endured it, sometimes with marvellous patience.</p>

<p>A dispute was now the consequence; both became furious; and at length
Voltaire snatched up a knife, and brandishing it exclaimed, "ne me
regarde donc pas avec tes yeux hagards et louches!" After such a scene
as this one would imagine that Love must have spread his light wings and
fled for ever. Could Emilie ever have forgiven those words, or Voltaire
have forgotten the look that provoked them?</p>

<p>But the <i>mobilit&eacute;</i> of his mind was one of the most extraordinary parts
of his character, and he was not more irascible than he was easily
appeased. Madame du Ch&acirc;telet maintained her power over him for twenty
years; during five of which they resided in her ch&acirc;teau at Cirey, under
the countenance of her husband; he was a good sort of man, but seems to
have been considered by these two geniuses and their guests as a
complete nonentity. He was "<i>Le bon-homme, le vilain petit Trichateau</i>"
whom it was a task to speak to, and a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span> penance to amuse. Every day,
after coffee, Monsieur rose from the table with all the docility
imaginable, leaving Voltaire and Madame to recite verses, translate
Newton, philosophise, dispute, and do the honours of Cirey to the
brilliant society who had assembled under his roof.</p>

<p>While the boudoir, the laboratory, and the sleeping-room of the lady,
and the study and gallery appropriated to Voltaire, were furnished with
Oriental luxury and splendour, and shone with gilding, drapery,
pictures, and baubles, the lord of the mansion and the guests were
destined to starve in half-furnished apartments, from which the wind and
the rain were scarcely excluded.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>In 1748, Voltaire and Madame du Ch&acirc;telet paid a visit to the Court of
Stanislas, the ex-king of Poland, at Luneville, and took M. du Ch&acirc;telet
in their train. There Madame du Ch&acirc;telet was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span> seized with a passion for
Saint-Lambert, the author of the "Saisons," who was at least ten or
twelve years younger than herself, and then a <i>jeune militaire</i>, only
admired for his fine figure and pretty <i>vers de soci&eacute;t&eacute;</i>. Voltaire, it
is said, was extremely jealous; but his jealousy did not prevent him
from addressing some very elegant verses to his handsome rival, in which
he compliments him gaily on the good graces of the lady.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Saint-Lambert, ce n'est que pour toi<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Que ces belles fleurs sont &eacute;closes,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">C'est ta main qui cueille les roses,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Et les &eacute;pines sont pour moi!<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Some months afterwards, Madame du Ch&acirc;telet died in child-birth, in her
forty-fourth year.</p>

<p>Voltaire was so overwhelmed by this loss, that he set off for Paris
immediately <i>pour se dissiper</i>. Marmontel has given us a most ludicrous
account of a visit of condolence he paid him on this occasion. He found
Voltaire absolutely drowned in tears, and at every fresh burst of
sorrow, he called<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span> on Marmontel to sympathise with him. "Helas! j'ai
perdu mon illustre amie! Ah! ah! je suis au desespoir!"&mdash;Then exclaiming
against Saint-Lambert, whom he accused as the cause of the
catastrophe&mdash;"Ah! mon ami! il me l'a tu&eacute;e, le brutal!" while Marmontel,
who had often heard him abuse his "<i>sublime</i> Emilie" in no measured
terms, as "une furie, attach&eacute;e &agrave; ses pas," hid his face with his
handkerchief in pretended sympathy, but in reality to conceal his
irrepressible smiles. In the midst of this scene of despair, some
ridiculous idea or story striking Voltaire's vivid fancy, threw him into
fits of laughter, and some time elapsed before he recollected that he
was inconsolable.</p>

<p>The death of Madame du Ch&acirc;telet, the circumstances which attended it,
and the celebrity of herself and her lover, combined to cause a great
<i>sensation</i>. No elegies indeed appeared on the occasion,&mdash;"no tears
eternal that embalm the dead;" but a shower of epigrams and <i>bon
mots</i>&mdash;some exquisitely witty and malicious. The story of her ring, in
which Voltaire and her husband<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span> each expected to find his own portrait,
and which on being opened, was found, to the utter discomfiture of both,
to contain that of Saint-Lambert, is well known.</p>

<p>If we may judge from her picture, Madame du Ch&acirc;telet must have been
extremely pretty. Her eyes were fine and piercing; her features
delicate, with a good deal of <i>finesse</i> and intelligence in their
expression. But her countenance, like her character, was devoid of
interest. She had great power of mental abstraction; and on one occasion
she went through a most complicated calculation of figures in her head,
while she played and won a game at piquet. She <i>could</i> be graceful and
fascinating, but her manners were, in general, extremely disagreeable;
and her parade of learning, her affectation, her egotism, her utter
disregard of the comforts, feelings, and opinions of others, are well
pourtrayed in two or three brilliant strokes of sarcasm from the pen of
Madame de Stael.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span> even turns her philosophy into ridicule.
"Elle fait actuellement la revue de ses Principes;<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> c'est un
exercise qu'elle r&eacute;it&egrave;re chaque ann&eacute;e, sans quoi ils pourroient
s'&eacute;chapper; et peut-&ecirc;tre s'en aller si loin qu'elle n'en retrouverait
pas un seul. Je crois bien que sa t&ecirc;te est pour eux une maison de force,
et non pas le lieu de leur naissance."<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span></p><p>That Madame du Ch&acirc;telet was a woman of extraordinary talent, and that
her progress in abstract sciences was uncommon, and even <i>unique</i> at
that time, at least among her own sex, is beyond a doubt; but her
learned treatises on Newton, and the nature of fire, are now utterly
forgotten. We have since had a Mrs. Marcet; and we have read of Gaetana
Agnesi, who was professor of mathematics in the University of Padua; two
women who, uniting to the rarest philosophical acquirements, gentleness
and virtue, have needed no poet to immortalize them.</p>

<p>Of the numerous poems which Voltaire addressed to Madame du Ch&acirc;telet,
the Epistle beginning</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Tu m'appelles &agrave; toi, vaste et puissant g&eacute;nie,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Minerve de la France, immortelle Emilie,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>is a <i>chef d'&oelig;uvre</i>, and contains some of the finest lines he ever
wrote. The Epistle to her on calumny, written to console her for the
abuse and ridicule which her abstractions and indiscretions had
provoked, begins with these beautiful lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Ecoutez-moi, respectable Emilie:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Vous &ecirc;tes belle; ainsi donc la moiti&eacute;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>

<span class="i2">On vous craindra; votre tendre amiti&eacute;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Simple et sans fard, n'a point sacrifi&eacute;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A nos d&eacute;vots; craignez la calomnie.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>With that famous ring, from which he had afterwards the mortification to
discover that his own portrait had been banished to make room for that
of Saint-Lambert, he sent her this elegant <i>quatrain</i>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Barier grava ces traits destin&eacute;s pour vos yeux;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Mais ce fut par un plus grand maitre.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The heroine of the famous Epistle, known as "Les <span class="smcap">tu</span> et les <span class="smcap">vous</span>,"
(Madame de Gouvern&eacute;,) was one of Voltaire's earliest loves; and he was
passionately attached to her. They were separated in the world:&mdash;she
went through the usual <i>routine</i> of a French woman's existence,&mdash;I mean,
of a French woman <i>sous l'ancien r&eacute;gime</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Quelques plaisirs dans la jeunesse,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Des soins dans la maternit&eacute;,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Tous les malheurs dans la vieillesse,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Puis la peur de l'&eacute;ternit&eacute;.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She was first dissipated; then an <i>esprit fort</i>; then <i>tr&egrave;s d&eacute;vote</i>. In
obedience to her confessor, she discarded, one after the other, her
rouge, her ribbons, and the presents and billets-doux of her lovers; but
no remonstrances could induce her to give up Voltaire's picture. When he
returned from exile in 1778, he went to pay a visit to his old love;
they had not met for fifty years, and they now gazed on each other in
silent dismay. <i>He</i> looked, I suppose, like the dried mummy of an ape:
<i>she</i>, like a withered <i>sorci&egrave;re</i>. The same evening she sent him back
his portrait, which she had hitherto refused to part with. Nothing
remained to shed illusion over the past; she had beheld, even before the
last terrible proof&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">What dust we doat on, when 'tis man we love.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And Voltaire, on his side, was not less dismayed by his visit. On
returning from her, he exclaimed, with a shrug of mingled disgust and
horror, "Ah,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span> mes amis! je viens de passer &agrave; l'autre bord du Cocyte!" It
was not thus that Cowper felt for his Mary, when "her auburn locks were
changed to grey:" but it is almost an insult to the memory of true
tenderness to mention them both in the same page.</p>

<p>To enumerate other women who have been celebrated by Voltaire, would be
to give a list of all the beautiful and distinguished women of France
for half a century; from the Duchess de Richelieu and Madame de
Luxembourg, down to Camargo the dancer, and Clairon and le Couvreur the
actresses: but I can find no name of any <i>poetical</i> fame or interest
among them: nor can I conceive any thing more revolting than the history
of French society and manners during the Regency and the whole of the
reign of Louis the Fifteenth.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<h3>FRENCH POETRY CONTINUED.</h3>

<h3>MADAME D'HOUDETOT.</h3>


<p>Saint-Lambert, who seemed destined to rival greater men than himself,
after carrying off Madame du Ch&acirc;telet from Voltaire, became the favoured
lover of the Comtesse d'Houdetot, Rousseau's Sophie; she for whom the
philosopher first felt love, "<i>dans toute son energie, toutes ses
fureurs</i>,"&mdash;but in vain.</p>

<p>Saint-Lambert is allowed to be an elegant poet: his <i>Saisons</i> were once
as popular in France, as Thomson's Seasons are here; but they have not
retained their popularity. The French poem, though in many parts
imitated from the English,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span> is as unlike it as possible: correct,
polished, elegant, full of beautiful lines,&mdash;of what the French call <i>de
beaux vers</i>,&mdash;and yet excessively dull. It is equally impossible to find
fault with it in parts, or endure it as a whole. <i>Une petite pointe de
verve</i> would have rendered it delightful; but the total want of
enthusiasm in the writer freezes the reader. As Madame du Deffand said,
in humorous mockery of his monotonous harmony, "Sans les oiseaux, les
ruisseaux, les hameaux, les ormeaux, et leur rameaux, il aurait bien pen
de choses a dire!"</p>

<p>Madame d'Houdetot was the <i>Doris</i> to whom the Seasons are dedicated; and
the opening passage addressed to her, is extremely admired by French
critics.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Et toi, qui m'as choisi pour embellir ma vie,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Doux r&eacute;pos de mon c&oelig;ur, aimable et tendre amie!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Toi, qui sais de nos champs admirer les beaut&eacute;s:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">D&eacute;robe toi, Doris! au luxe des cit&eacute;s,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Aux arts dont tu jouis, au monde o&ugrave; tu s&ccedil;ais plaire;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Heureux si pr&egrave;s de toi je chante &agrave; son retour,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ses dons et ses plaisirs, la campagne et l'amour!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Sophie de la Briche, afterwards Madame<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span> d'Houdetot, was the daughter of
a rich <i>fermier general</i>; and destined, of course, to a marriage de
convenance, she was united very young to the Comte d'Houdetot, an
officer of rank in the army; a man who was allowed by his friends to be
<i>tr&egrave;s peu amiable</i>, and whom Madame d'Epinay, who hated him, called
<i>vilain</i>, and <i>insupportable</i>. He was too good-natured to make his wife
absolutely miserable, but <i>un bonheur &agrave; faire mourir d'ennui</i>, was not
exactly adapted to the disposition of Sophie; and there was no principle
within, no restraint without, no support, no counsel, no example, to
guide her conduct or guard her against temptation.</p>

<p>The power by which Madame d'Houdetot captivated the gay, handsome,
dissipated Saint-Lambert, and kindled into a blaze the passions or the
imagination of Rousseau, was not that of beauty. Her face was plain and
slightly marked with the small-pox; her eyes were not good; she was
extremely short-sighted, which gave to her countenance and address an
appearance of uncertainty and timidity; her figure was <i>mignonne</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span> and
in all her movements there was an indescribable mixture of grace and
awkwardness. The charm by which this woman seized and kept the hearts,
not of lovers only, but of friends, was a character the very reverse of
that of Madame du Ch&acirc;telet, who would have deemed it an insult to be
compared to her either in mind or beauty:&mdash;the absence of all
<i>pretension</i>, all coquetry; the total surrender of her own feelings,
thoughts, interests, where another was concerned; the frankness which
verged on giddiness and imprudence; the temper which nothing could
ruffle; the warm kindness which nothing could chill; the bounding spirit
of gaiety, which nothing could subdue,&mdash;these qualities rendered Madame
d'Houdetot an attaching and interesting creature, to the latest moment
of her long life. "Mon Dieu! que j'ai d'impatience de voir dix ans de
plus sur la t&ecirc;te de cette femme!" exclaimed her sister-in-law, Madame
d'Epinay, when she saw her at the age of twenty. But at the age of
eighty, Madame d'Houdetot was just as much a child as ever,&mdash;"aussi
vive, aussi enfant, aussi gaie, aussi distraite, aussi bonne<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span> et tr&egrave;s
bonne;"<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> in spite of wrinkles, sorrows, and frailties, she retained,
in extreme old age, the gaiety, the tenderness, the confiding
simplicity, though not the innocence of early youth.</p>

<p>Her <i>liaison</i> with Saint-Lambert continued fifty years, nor was she ever
suspected of any other indiscretion. During this time he contrived to
make her as wretched as a woman of her disposition could be made; and
the elasticity of her spirits did not prevent her from being acutely
sensible to pain, and alive to unkindness. Saint-Lambert, from being her
lover, became her tyrant. He behaved with a peevish jealousy, a
petulance, a bitterness, which sometimes drove her beyond the bounds of
a woman's patience; and when ever this happened, the accommodating
husband, M. d'Houdetot would interfere to reconcile the lovers, and
plead for the recall of the offender.</p>

<p>When Saint-Lambert's health became utterly broken, she watched over him
with a patient tenderness, unwearied by all his <i>exigeance</i>, and
unprovoked by his detestable temper; he had a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span> house near her's in the
valley of Montmorenci, and lived on perfectly good terms with her
husband. I must add one trait, which, however absurd, and scarcely
credible, it may sound in our sober, English ears, is yet true. M. and
Madame d'Houdetot gave a f&ecirc;te at Eaubonne, to celebrate the fiftieth
anniversary of their marriage. Sophie was then nearly <i>seventy</i>, but
played her part, as the heroine of the day, with all the grace and
vivacity of seventeen. On this occasion, the lover and the husband
chose, for the first time in their lives, to be jealous of each other,
and exhibited, to the amusement and astonishment of the guests, a
<i>scene</i>, which was for some time the talk of all Paris.</p>

<p>Saint-Lambert died in 1805. After his death, Madame d'Houdetot was
seized with a sentimental <i>tendresse</i> for M. Somariva,<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> and
continued to send him bouquets and billets-doux to the end of her life.
She died about 1815.</p>

<p>To her singular power of charming, Madame d'Houdetot added talents of no
common order,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span> which, though never cultivated with any perseverance, now
and then displayed, or rather <i>disclosed</i> themselves unexpectedly,
adding surprise to pleasure. She was a musician, a poetess, a wit;&mdash;but
every thing, "par la gr&agrave;ce de Dieu,"&mdash;and as if unconsciously and
involuntarily. All Saint-Lambert's poetry together is not worth the
little song she composed for him on his departure for the army:&mdash;</p>

up of genius and imagination, and as destitute of heart as of moral
principle. I can never think of his character, but as of something at
once admirable, portentous and shocking; the most great, most gifted,
most wretched;&mdash;worst, meanest, maddest of mankind!</p>

<p>Madame du Ch&acirc;telet and Madame d'Houdetot must for the present be deemed
sufficient specimens of French poetical heroines;&mdash;it were easy to

<p>Is it not singular that in a country which was the cradle, if not the
birth-place of modern poetry and romance, the language, the literature,
and the women, should be so essentially and incurably <i>prosaic</i>? The
muse of French poetry never swept a lyre; she grinds a barrel-organ in
her serious moods, and she scrapes a fiddle in her lively ones; and as
for the distinguished French women, whose memory and whose characters
are blended with the literature, and connected with the great names of
their country,&mdash;they are often admirable, and sometimes interesting; but
with all their fascinations, their charms, their <i>esprit</i>, their
<i>graces</i>, their <i>amabilit&eacute;</i>, and their <i>sensibilit&eacute;</i>, it was not in the
power of the gods or their lovers to make them <i>poetical</i>.</p>

<h3>HEROINES OF MODERN POETRY.</h3>

<p>It will be allowed, I think, that women have reason to be satisfied with
the rank they hold in modern poetry; and that the homage which has been
addressed to them, either directly and individually, or paid indirectly
and generally, in the beautiful characters and portraits drawn of them,
ought to satisfy equally female sentiment and female vanity. From the
half ethereal forms which float amid moonbeams and gems, and odours and
flowers, along the dazzling pages of Lalla Rookh,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span> down to Ph&oelig;be
Dawson, in the Parish Register:<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> from that loveliest gem of polished
life, the young Aurora of Lord Byron, down to Wordsworth's poor Margaret
weeping in her deserted cottage;<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>&mdash;all the various aspects between
these wide extremes of character and situation, under which we have been
exhibited, have been, with few exceptions, just and favourable to our
sex.</p>

<p>In the literature of the classical ages, we were debased into mere
servants of pleasure, alternately the objects of loose incense or coarse
invective. In the poetry of the Gothic ages, we all rank as queens. In
the succeeding period, when the platonic philosophy was oddly mixed up
with the institutions of chivalry, we were exalted into
divinities;&mdash;"angels called, and angel-like adored." Then followed the
age of French gallantry, tinged with classical elegance, and tainted
with classical licence, when we were caressed, complimented, wooed and
satirised by coxcomb poets,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Who ever mix'd their song with light licentious toys.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span></p><p>There was much expenditure of wit and of talent, but in an ill
cause;&mdash;for the feeling was, <i>au fond</i>, bad and false;&mdash;"et il n'est
guere plaisant d'&ecirc;tre empoisonn&eacute;, m&ecirc;me par l'esprit de rose."</p>

<p>In the present time a better spirit prevails. We are not indeed
sublimated into goddesses; but neither is it the fashion to degrade us
into the playthings of fopling poets. We seem to have found, at length,
our proper level in poetry, as in society; and take the place assigned
to us as women&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">As creatures not too bright or good,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For human nature's daily food;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For transient sorrows, simple wiles,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Praise, blame, love, kisses, tears and smiles!<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We are represented as ruling by our feminine attractions, moral or
exterior, the passions and imaginations of men; as claiming, by our
weakness, our delicacy, our devotion,&mdash;their protection, their
tenderness, and their gratitude: and, since<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span> the minds of women have
been more generally and highly cultivated; since a Madame de Stael, a
Joanna Baillie, a Maria Edgeworth, and a hundred other names, now
shining aloft like stars, have shed a reflected glory on the whole sex
they belong to, we possess through them, a claim to admiration and
respect for our mental capabilities. We assume the right of passing
judgment on the poetical homage addressed to us, and our smiles alone
can consecrate what our smiles first inspired.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>If we look over the mass of poetry produced during the last twenty-five
years, whether Italian, French, German, or English, we shall find that
the predominant feeling is honourable to women, and if not gallantry, is
something better.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> It is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span> too true, that the incense has not been
always perfectly pure. "Many light lays,&mdash;ah, woe is me
there-fore!"<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> have sounded from one gifted lyre, which has since
been strung to songs of patriotism and tenderness. Moore, whom I am
proud, for a thousand reasons, to claim as my countryman, began his
literary and amatory career, fresh from the study of the classics, and
the poets of Charles the Second's time; and too often through the thin
undress of superficial refinement, we trace the grossness of his models.
It is said, I know not how truly, that he has since made the <i>amende
honorable</i>. He has possibly discovered, that women of sense and
sentiment, who have a true feeling of what is due to them as women, are
not fitly addressed in the style of Anacreon and Catullus; have no
sympathies with his equivocal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span> Rosas, Fanny, and Julias, and are not
flattered by being associated with tavern orgies and bumpers of wine,
and such "tipsey revelry." Into themes like these he has, it is true,
infused a buoyant spirit of gaiety, a tone of sentiment, and touches of
tender and moral feeling, which would reconcile us to them, if any thing
could; as in the beautiful songs, "When time, who steals our years
away,"&mdash;"O think not my spirits are always as light,"&mdash;"Farewell! but
whenever you think on the hour,"&mdash;"The Legacy," and a hundred others.
But how many <i>more</i> are there, in which the purity and earnestness of
the feeling vie with the grace and delicacy of the expression! and in
the difficult art (only to be appreciated by a singer) of marrying verse
to sound, Moore was never excelled&mdash;never equalled&mdash;but by Burns. He
seems to be gifted, as poet and musician, with a double instinct of
harmony, peculiar to himself.</p>

<p>Barry Cornwall is another living poet who has drunk deep from the
classics and from our older writers; but with a finer taste and a better
feeling, he has borrowed only what was decorative,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span> graceful and
accessory: the pure stream of his sentiment flows unmingled and
untainted,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Yet musical as when the waters run,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lapsing through sylvan haunts deliciously.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is not without reason that Barry Cornwall has been styled the "Poet
of woman," <i>par excellence</i>. It enhances the value, it adds to the charm
of every tender and beautiful passage addressed to us, that we know them
to be sincere and heartfelt,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i11">Not fable bred,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But such as truest poets love to write.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is for the sake of <i>one</i>, beloved "beyond ambition and the light of
song,"&mdash;and worthy to be so loved, that he approaches <i>all</i> women with
the most graceful, delicate, and reverential homage ever expressed in
sweet poetry. His fancy is indeed so luxuriant, that he makes whatever
he touches appear fanciful: but the beauty adorned by his verse, and
adorning his home, is not imaginary; and though he has almost hidden his
divinity behind a cloud of incense, she is not therefore less <i>real</i>.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span></p>
<p>The life Lord Byron led was not calculated to give him a good opinion of
women, or to place before him the best virtues of our sex. Of all modern
poets, he has been the most generally popular among female readers; and
he owes this enthusiasm not certainly to our obligations to <i>him</i>; for,
as far as women are concerned, we may designate his works by a line
borrowed from himself,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">With much to excite, there's little to exalt.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But who, like him, could administer to that "<i>besoin de sentir</i>" which I
am afraid is an ingredient in the feminine character all over the world?</p>

<p>Lord Byron is really the Grand Turk of amatory poetry,&mdash;ardent in his
love,&mdash;mean and merciless in his resentment: he could trace passion in
characters of fire, but his caustic satire burns and blisters where it
falls. Lovely as are some of his female portraits, and inimitably
beautiful as are some of his lyrical effusions, it must be confessed
there is something very Oriental in all his feelings and ideas about
women; he seems to require nothing of us but beauty and submission.
Please him&mdash;and he will crown you with the richest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span> flowers of poetry,
and heap the treasures of the universe at your feet, as trophies of his
love; but once offend, and you are lost,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">There yawns the sack&mdash;and yonder rolls the sea!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Campbell, ever elegant and tender, has hymned us all into divinities;
and through his sweet and varied page</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Where love pursues an ever devious race,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">True to the winding lineaments of grace,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>we figure under every beautiful aspect that truth and feeling could
inspire, or poetry depict.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott ought to have lived in the age of chivalry, (if we
could endure the thoughts of his living in any other age but our own!)
so touched with the true antique spirit of generous devotion to our sex
are all his poetical portraits of women. I do not find that he has, like
most other writers of the present day, mixed up his personal feelings
and history with his poetry; or that any fair and distinguished object
will be so thrice fortunate as to share his laurelled immortality. We
must therefore treat him like Shakspeare, whom alone he resembles&mdash;and
claim him for us all.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span></p>

<p>Then there is Rogers, whose compliments to us are so polished, so
pointed, and so elegantly turned, and have such a drawing-room air, that
they seem as if intended to be presented to Duchesses, by beaux in white
kid gloves. And there is Coleridge who approaches women with a sort of
feeling half earthly, half heavenly, like that with which an Italian
devotee bends before his Madonna&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And comes unto his courtship as his prayer.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And there is Southey, in whose imagination we are all heroines and
queens; and Wordsworth, lost in the depths of his own tenderness!</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The time is not yet arrived, when the loves of the living poets, or of
those lately dead, can be discussed individually, or exhibited at full
length. The subject is much too hazardous for a contemporary, and more
particularly for a female to dwell upon. Such details belong properly to
the next age, and there is no fear that these gossiping times will leave
any thing a mystery for posterity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span> The next generation will be
infinitely wiser on these interesting subjects than their grandmothers.
Yet a few years, and what is scandal and personality <i>now</i>, will <i>then</i>
be matter for biography and history. Then many a love, destined to rival
that of Petrarch in purity and celebrity, and that of Tasso in interest,
shall be divulged; the thread of many a poetical romance now coiled up
in mystic verse, shall then be evolved. Then we shall know the true
history of Lord Byron's "Fare thee well." We shall then know more than
the mere name of his Mary,<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> who first kindled his boyish fancy, and
left an ineffaceable impression on his young heart, and whose history is
said to be shadowed forth in "The Dream." We may then know who was the
heroine of "Remember him whom passion's power:" whose moonlight charms
at once so radiant and so shadowy, inspired "She walks in beauty;" we
shall be told, perhaps, who was the Thyrza, so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span> loving and beloved in
life, and whose early death, which appears to have taken place during
his travels, is so deeply, so feelingly lamented: and who was his
Ginevra,<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> and what spot of earth was made happy by her beautiful
presence&mdash;if any thing so divinely beautiful ever was!</p>

<p>Then we shall not ask in vain who was Campbell's Caroline?<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> Whether
she did, indeed, walk this earth in mortal beauty, or was not rather
invoked by the poet's spell, from the soft evening star which shone upon
her bower?</p>

<p>Then we shall know upon whose white bosom perished that rose,<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>
which, dying, bequeathed with its odorous breath a tale of truest love
to after-times, and glory to her, whose breast was its envied tomb&mdash;to
<i>her</i>, whose heart has thrilled to the homage of her poet,&mdash;yet who
would "<i>blush to find it fame</i>!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span></p><p>Then we shall know who was the "Lucy,"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">Beside the springs of Dove!<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and who was the heroine of that most exquisite picture of feminine
loveliness in all its aspects, "She was a Phantom of delight."<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>&mdash;No
phantom, it is said, but a fair reality:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">A being, breathing thoughtful breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A traveller betwixt life and death,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>yet fated not to die, while verse can live!</p>

<p>Then we shall know whose tear has been preserved by Rogers with a power
beyond "the Chymist's magic art;" who was the lovely bride who is
destined to blush and tremble in his Epithalamium, for a thousand years
to come; and to what fair obdurate is addressed his "Farewell."</p>

<p>We may then learn who was that sweet Mary who adorned the cottage-home
of Wilson; and who was the "Wild Louisa," of whom he has drawn such a
captivating picture; first as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span> the sprightly girl floating down the
dance,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">With footsteps light as falling snow,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and afterwards as the matron and the mother, hanging over the cradle of
her infant, and blessing him in his sleep.</p>

<p>Then we may <i>tell</i> who was the "Bonnie Jean," sung by Allan Cunningham,
whose destructive charms are so pleasantly, so naturally touched upon.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Sair she slights the lads&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Three are like to die;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Four in sorrow listed,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And five flew to sea!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This rural beauty, who caused such terrible devastation, and who, it is
said, first made a poet of her lover, became afterwards his wife; and in
her matronly character, she inspired that beautiful little effusion of
conjugal tenderness, "The Poet's Bridal Song." When first published, it
was almost universally copied, and committed to memory; and Allan
Cunningham may not only boast that he has woven a wreath "to grace his
Jean,"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">While rivers flow and woods are green,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span></div></div>

<p>but that he has given the sweet wife, seated among her children in
sedate and matronly loveliness, an interest even beyond that which
belongs to the young girl he has described with raven locks and cheeks
of cream, driving rustic admirers to despair, or lingering with her
lover at eve,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i11">&mdash;Amid the falling dew,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When looks were fond, and words were few!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Such is the charm of affection, and truth, and moral feeling, carried
straight into the heart by poetry!</p>

<p>What a new interest and charm will be given to many of Moore's beautiful
songs, when we are allowed to trace the feeling that inspired them,
whether derived from some immediate and present impression; or from
remembered emotion, that sometimes swells in the breast, like the
heaving of the waves, when the winds are still! Several of the most
charming of his lyrics are said to be inspired by "the heart so warm,
and eyes so bright," which first taught him the value of domestic
happiness;&mdash;taught him that the true poet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span> need not rove abroad for
themes of song, but may kindle his genius at the flame which glows on
his own hearth, and make the Muses his household goddesses.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>Gifford, the late editor of the Quarterly Review, and the author of the
Baviad and M&aelig;viad, was in early youth doomed to struggle with poverty,
obscurity, ill health, and every hardship which could check the rise of
genius. He has himself described the effect produced on his mind, under
these circumstances, by his attachment to an amiable and gentle girl. "I
crept on," he says, "in silent discontent, unfriended and unpitied;
indignant at the present, careless of the future,&mdash;an object at once of
apprehension and dislike. From this state of abjectness, I was raised by
a young woman of my own class.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span> She was a neighbour; and whenever I took
my solitary walk with my Wolfius in my pocket, she usually came to the
door, and by a smile, or a short question, put in the friendliest
manner, endeavoured to solicit my attention. My heart had been long shut
to kindness; but the sentiment was not dead within me; it revived at the
first encouraging word; and the gratitude I felt for it, was the first
pleasing sensation I had ventured to entertain for many dreary months."</p>

<p>There are two little effusions inserted in the notes to the Baviad and
M&aelig;viad, which have since been multiplied by copies, and have found their
way into almost all collections of lyric poetry and "Elegant Extracts;"
one of these was composed during the life of Anna; the other, written
after her death, and beginning,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">I wish I were where Anna lies,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For I am sick of lingering here,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>is extremely striking from its unadorned simplicity and profound
pathos.&mdash;Such was not the prevailing style of amatory verse at the time
it was written, nearly fifty years ago. Mr. Gifford never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span> married; and
the effect of this early disappointment could be traced in his mind and
constitution to the last moments of his life.</p>

<p>The same sad bereavement which tended to make Gifford a caustic critic
and satirist, made Mr. Bowles a sentimental poet. The subject of his
Sonnets was real; but he who has pointed out the difference between
natural and fabricated feeling, should not have left a <i>blank</i> for the
name of her he laments. He gives us indeed a formal permission to fill
up the blank with any name we choose. But it is not the same thing; the
name of the woman who inspired a poet, is quite as important to
posterity, as the name of the poet himself.</p>

<p>Who was the Hannah, whose fickleness occasioned that exquisite little
poem which Montgomery has inscribed "To the memory of her who is dead to
me?" It tells a tale of youthful love, of trusting affection, suddenly
and eternally blighted,&mdash;and with such a brevity, such a simplicity,
such a fervent yet heart-broken earnestness, that I fear it must be
true!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span></p>

<p>At some future time, we shall, perhaps, be told who was the beautiful
English girl, whose retiring charms won the heart of Hyppolito
Pindemonte, when he was here some years ago. His Canzone on her is, in
Italy, considered as his masterpiece,<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> and even compared to some of
Petrarch's. There are indeed few things in the compass of Italian poetry
more sweet in expression, more true to feeling, than the lines in which
Pindemonte, describing the blooming youth, the serene and quiet grace of
this fair girl, disclaims the idea of even wishing to disturb the
heavenly calm of her pure heart by a passion such as agitates his own.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Il men di che pu&ograve; Donna esser cortese<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ver chi l'ha di s&egrave; stesso assai pi&ugrave; cara,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Da te, vergine pura, io non vorrei.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This was being very peculiarly disinterested.&mdash;We may also learn, at
some future time, who was the sweet Elvire, to whom Alphonse de
Lamartine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span> has promised immortality, and not promised more than he has
the power to bestow. He is one of the few French poets, who have created
a real and a strong interest out of their own country. He has
vanquished, by the mere force of genius and sentiment, all the
difficulties and deficiencies of the language in which he wrote, and has
given to its limited poetical vocabulary a charm unknown before. He thus
addresses Elvire in one of the <i>Meditations Po&euml;tiques</i>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Vois, d'un &oelig;il de piti&eacute;, la vulgaire jeunesse<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Brillante de beaut&eacute;, s'enivrant de plaisir;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Quand elle aura tari sa coupe enchanteresse,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Que restera-t-il d'elle? &agrave; peine un souvenir:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Le tombeau qui l'attend l'engloutit tout enti&egrave;re,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Un silence &eacute;ternel succ&egrave;de &agrave; ses amours;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Mais les si&egrave;cles auront pass&eacute; sur ta poussi&egrave;re,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Elvire!&mdash;et tu vivras toujours!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Over some of the heroines of modern poetry, the tomb has recently
closed; and the flowers scattered there, could not be disturbed without
awakening a pang in the bosoms of those who survive.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span> They sleep, but
only for a while: they shall rise again&mdash;the grave shall yield them up,
"even in the loveliest looks they wore," for a poet's love has redeemed
them from death and from oblivion! Methinks I see them even now with the
prophetic eye of fancy, go floating over the ocean of time, in the light
of their beauty and their fame, like Galatea and her nymphs triumphing
upon the waters!</p>

<p>Others, perhaps, (the widow of Burns, and the widow of Monti, for
instance,) are declining into wintry age: sorrow and thought have
quenched the native beauty on their cheek, and furrowed the once
polished brow; yet crowned by poetry with eternal youth and unfading
charms, they will go down to posterity among the Lauras, the Geraldines,
the Sacharissas of other days;&mdash;Nature herself shall feel decrepitude,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And, palsy-smitten, shake her starry brows,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>ere these grow old and die!</p>

<p>And some, even now, move gracefully through the shades of domestic life,
and the universe, of whose beauty they will ere long form a part, knows<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
them not. Undistinguished among the ephemeral divinities around them,
not looking as though they felt the future glory round their brow, nor
swelling with anticipated fame, they yet carry in their mild eyes, that
light of love, which has inspired undying strains,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And Queens hereafter shall be proud to live<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Upon the alms of their superfluous praise!<br /></span>

electronic works

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
